  abstract = {An occupation measure describes the expected amount of time a stochastic
	process spends in different parts of its state space prior to a given
	random time. It is shown that a basic identity involving occupation
	measures provides a unified approach to a variety of moment identities
	for Markov chains, and some connections with potential theory are
	made.},
