	Abstract = {An electromyographically-controlled elbow prosthesis, the {"Boston} arm", was tested with constant and sinusoidally-modulated inputs under different loading conditions. These tests were used to determine the frequency response of the {EMG} amplifier, the range of motor speeds, the force-velocity curve, and the frequency response of the prosthesis for cyclic movements. Human biceps muscle was tested during movements under similar loads, and under isometric conditions using random, electrical stimuli to determine its frequency response. The results were compared to evaluate the performance of the prosthesis and contrast its characteristics to those of the physiological system it replaces. The prosthesis minimizes quiescent power drain, and the possibilities of instability or "tremor" by employing velocity control, an overdamped mechanical system, and an electrical "dead-band". These factors limit the ability of the prosthesis to follow rapidly changing inputs or to move rapidly and accurately to a desired position. These comparisons should provide a useful supplement to the usual clinical evaluations, and a starting point for further improvements in prosthesis design.},

	Abstract = {An investigation of feedback control of coronal plane posture in paraplegic subjects who stand using functional neuromuscular stimulation {(FNS)} is described. A feedback control system directed at regulating coronal plane hip angle in neutral position was designed, implemented, and evaluated in two paraplegic subjects. The feedback controller consisted of two-stages in cascade: a modified discrete-time proportional-integral-derivative {(PID)} stage and a nonlinear single-input, multiple-output stage to determine the stimulation to be sent to several muscles. The authors evaluate the performance of the feedback controller by comparing the response of the feedback-controlled system to that of an open-loop stimulation system. In an evaluation based on temporal response characteristics the controlled system exhibited at 41\% reduction in root-mean-squared {(RMS)} error (where error is defined as the deviation from the desired angle), a 52\% reduction in steady-state error, and a 22\% reduction in hip compliance. The feedback-controlled system also exhibited significant reductions in the variability of these measures on several days.},

	Abstract = {Systems that use electrical stimulation to activate paralyzed muscles, called ``neuroprostheses'', have restored important functional capabilities to many people with neurologic disorders such as spinal cord injury or stroke. However, the clinical benefits derived from neuroprostheses have been limited by the quality of control of posture and movement that has been achieved. Over the past few decades, engineers have used mathematical models and control systems technology to develop functional neuromuscular stimulation {(FNS)} control systems that show promise in the laboratory, but these have not yet been incorporated into practical solutions for clinical problems. This article briefly reviews several of the complicating factors in controlling {FNS} systems and describes the potential roles of biomechanical modeling and advanced control system technology. Three important challenges in {FNS} control systems research and development are identified: 1) to obtain an improved understanding of the biomechanical system that we are trying to control and how it is controlled by the intact neural system, 2) to develop new control system technology with a particular focus on strategies that mimic those used by biologic systems, and 3) to integrate the knowledge and technologies into useful systems that meet the needs of neuroprosthesis users. The outlook for the future includes many interesting problems; yet more importantly, it includes relevant clinical benefits to be gained through the application of biomechanical models and advanced control systems techniques in neuroprostheses.},

	Abstract = {Energetic autonomy of a hydraulic-based mobile field robot requires a power source capable of both electrical and hydraulic power generation. While the hydraulic power is used for locomotion, the electric power is used for the computer, sensors and other peripherals. An internal combustion engine was used as the prime mover due to the high energy density of gasoline. The primary specification for this hybrid hydraulic-electric power unit {(HEPU)} is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by modulating a hydraulic solenoid valve and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. Several hydraulic-electric power units were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton {(BLEEX)} shown on bleex.me.berkeley.edu/bleex.htm. A prototype power unit weighs 27 Kg, outputs 2.3 {kW} (3.0 hp) hydraulic power at 6.9 {MPa} (1000 psi), and 220 W of electric power at 15 {VDC.}},

	Abstract = {A system has been developed which is able to impose a fast ankle rotation during gait. The two-link system consists of a mechanical joint which is strapped to the calf and the foot of the subject. The mechanical joint turns around the ankle joint by means of Bowden wires and it is connected to a motor placed next to a treadmill where the subject is walking. By position feedback from the mechanical joint the motor is regulated in such a may that it follows the movement of the ankle joint without influencing the gait pattern. The system is designed to impose a fast ankle rotation with a displacement of up to 20$\,^{\circ}$, e.g., a 8$\,^{\circ}$ stretch is performed with a rise time of 32 ms during any time of the gait cycle. The system attached to the subject's leg weights in total 0.9 kg. The system is designed to elicit a stretch reflex in the ankle extensor muscles during walking. The prospect of the system is to investigate electrophysiological and biomechanical features during a naturally evoked stretch reflex of the ankle extensors in both healthy and motor impaired subjects. The system is able to produce a perturbation of the ankle extensors at a walking speed of up to 6 km/h during the total gait cycle},

	Abstract = {It is well documented that both cognitive and motor learning abilities decline with normative aging. Given that cognitive processes such as working memory are engaged during the early stages of motor learning {[Anguera}, J., {Reuter-Lorenz}, P., Willingham, D., \& Seidler, R. Contributions of spatial working memory to visuomotor learning. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 22(9), 1917-1930, 2010], age-related declines in motor learning may be due in part to reductions in cognitive ability. The present study examined whether age-related declines in spatial working memory {(SWM)} contribute to deficits in visuomotor adaptation. Young and older adult participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task that involved adapting manual aiming movements to a 30$\,^{\circ}$ rotation of the visual feedback display as well as an {SWM} task in an {fMRI} scanner. Young adults showed a steeper learning curve than older adults during the early adaptation period. The rate of early adaptation was correlated with {SWM} performance for the young, but not older, adults. Both groups showed similar brain activation patterns for the {SWM} task, including engagement of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. However, when the {SWM} activation was used as a limiting mask, younger adults showed neural activation that overlapped with the early adaptation period, whereas older adults did not. A partial correlation controlling for age revealed that the rate of early adaptation correlated with the amount of activation at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that a failure to effectively engage {SWM} processes during learning contributes to age-related deficits in visuomotor adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Error detection and correction are essential components of motor skill learning. These processes have been well characterized in cognitive psychology using electroencephalography {(EEG)} to record an event-related potential {(ERP)} called error-related negativity {(ERN).} However, it is unclear whether this {ERP} component is sensitive to the magnitude of the error made in a sensorimotor adaptation task. In the present study, we tested the function of error-related activity in a visuomotor adaptation task. To examine whether error size is reflected in the {ERP}, two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to either a small (30$\,^{\circ}$) or large (45$\,^{\circ}$) rotation of the visual feedback display. Each participant's trials were sorted into large and small error trials using a median split to examine potential error magnitude waveform differences. We also examined these trial types at the early and late stages of adaptation. There were no group differences for the behavioral or neural measures; however, waveforms from large error trials were significantly different from small error trials. The waveforms also changed as a function of practice as early adaptation waveforms were larger than late adaptation waveforms. The observed {ERP} component reflected differences in error magnitude with the amount of activity corresponding to the size of the error. Movement monitoring potentials likely affected the frequency and time course of the waveform so that it did not resemble the typical {ERN;} however, error-related activity was still distinguishable. The present findings are discussed in terms of current theories of the {ERN} as well as skill acquisition.},

We introduce the idea that, in addition to extending the body schema to incorporate the tool, tool use involves distalization of the end-effector from hand to tool. Different tools extend the body schema in different ways, with a displaced visual target and a novel, task-specific processing of haptic feedback to the hand. This distalization is critical in order to exploit the unique functional capacities engendered by complex tools.},

	Abstract = {The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors.},

@article{baddeley_system_2003,
	Abstract = {Sensory-motor integration has frequently been studied using a single-step change in a control variable such as prismatic lens angle and has revealed human visuomotor adaptation to often be partial and inefficient. We propose that the changes occurring in everyday life are better represented as the accumulation of many smaller perturbations contaminated by measurement noise. We have therefore tested human performance to random walk variations in the visual feedback of hand movements during a pointing task. Subjects made discrete targeted pointing movements to a visual target and received terminal feedback via a cursor the position of which was offset from the actual movement endpoint by a random walk element and a random observation element. By applying ideal observer analysis, which for this task compares human performance against that of a Kalman filter, we show that the subjects' performance was highly efficient with Fisher efficiencies reaching 73\%. We then used system identification techniques to characterize the control strategy used. A ``modified'' delta-rule algorithm best modeled the human data, which suggests that they estimated the random walk perturbation of feedback in this task using an exponential weighting of recent errors. The time constant of the exponential weighting of the best-fitting model varied with the rate of random walk drift. Because human efficiency levels were high and did not vary greatly across three levels of observation noise, these results suggest that the algorithm the subjects used exponentially weighted recent errors with a weighting that varied with the level of drift in the task to maintain efficient performance.},

	Abstract = {Although sensorimotor adaptation is typically thought of as an implicit form of learning, it has been shown that participants who gain explicit awareness of the nature of the perturbation during adaptation exhibit more learning than those who do not. With rare exceptions, however, explicit awareness is typically polled at the end of the study. Here, we provided participants with either an explicit spatial strategy or no instructions before learning. Early in learning, explicit instructions greatly reduced movement errors but also resulted in increased trial-to-trial variability and longer reaction times. Late in adaptation, performance was indistinguishable between the explicit and implicit groups, but the mechanisms underlying performance improvements remained fundamentally different, as revealed by catch trials. The progression of implicit recalibration in the explicit group was modulated by the use of an explicit strategy: these participants showed a lower level of recalibration as well as decreased aftereffects. This phenomenon may be due to the reduced magnitude of errors made to the target during adaptation or inhibition of implicit learning mechanisms by explicit processing.},

Typically, these investigations have not evaluated the organization of the resting brain, which can help to determine whether more diffuse representations reflect physiological or task-dependent effects. In the present study we used transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} to determine whether there are differences in motor cortex organization of both brain hemispheres in young and older adults. We measured resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential {(MEP)} latency and amplitude, and extent of first dorsal interosseous representations, in addition to a computerized measure of reaction time. There was no significant age difference in motor threshold, but we did find that {OA} had larger contralateral {MEP} amplitudes and a longer contralateral {MEP} latency. Furthermore, the spatial extent of motor representations in {OA} was larger. We found that larger dominant hemisphere motor representations in {OA} were associated with higher reaction times, suggesting dedifferentiation rather than compensation effects.},

	Abstract = {Motor system organization varies with handedness. However, previous work has focused almost exclusively on direction of handedness (right or left) as opposed to degree of handedness (strength). In the present study, we determined whether measures of interhemispheric interactions and degree of handedness are related to contra- and ipsilateral motor cortical representations. Participants completed a battery of handedness assessments including both handedness preference measures and behavioral measures of intermanual differences in dexterity, a computerized version of the Poffenberger paradigm {(PP)} to estimate interhemispheric transfer time {(IHTT)}, and they underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} mapping of both motor cortices while we recorded muscle activity from the first dorsal interosseous muscle bilaterally. A greater number of ipsilateral motor evoked potentials {(iMEPs)} were elicited in less lateralized individuals with the number of {iMEPs} correlated with {IHTT.} There were no relationships between handedness or lateralization of dexterity and symmetry of contralateral motor representations, although this symmetry was related to {IHTT.} Finally, {IHTT} was positively correlated with multiple measures of laterality and handedness. These findings demonstrate that degree of laterality of dexterity is related to the propensity for exhibiting {iMEPs} and the speed of interhemispheric interactions. However, it is not clear whether {iMEPs} are directly mediated via ipsilateral corticospinal projections or are transcallosally transmitted.},

	Abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional {MRI} {(R-fMRI)} constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency ({\textless}0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the {fMRI} signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering {R-fMRI} data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent {R-fMRI} datasets can be aggregated and shared.

	Abstract = {It has been shown that varying the spatial versus symbolic nature of stimulus presentation and response production, which affects stimulus-response {(S-R)} mapping requirements, influences the magnitude of implicit sequence learning {(Koch} and Hoffman, 2000). Here, we evaluated how spatial and symbolic stimuli and responses affect the neural bases of sequence learning. We selectively eliminated the spatial component of stimulus presentation (spatial vs. symbolic), response execution (manual vs. vocal), or both. Fourteen participants performed the alternating serial reaction time task under these conditions in an {MRI} scanner, with interleaved acquisition to allow for recording of vocal response reaction times. Nine regions of interest {(ROIs)} were selected to test the hypothesis that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex {(DLPFC)} was preferentially engaged for spatially cued conditions and cerebellum lobule {HVI}, crus I and {II} were associated with symbolically cued learning. We found that the left cerebellum lobule {HVI} was selectively recruited for symbolic learning and the percent signal change in this region was correlated with learning magnitude under the symbolic conditions. In contrast, the {DLPFC} did not exhibit selective activation for learning under spatial conditions. The inferior parietal lobule exhibited increased activation during learning regardless of the condition, supporting its role in forming an abstract representation of learned sequences. These findings reveal different brain networks that are flexibly engaged depending on the conditions of sequence learning.},

	Abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that older adults exhibit deficits in motor sequence learning, but the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Our recent work has shown that visuospatial working-memory capacity predicts the rate of motor sequence learning and the length of motor chunks formed during explicit sequence learning in young adults. In the current study, we evaluate whether age-related deficits in working memory explain the reduced rate of motor sequence learning in older adults. We found that older adults exhibited a correlation between visuospatial working-memory capacity and motor sequence chunk length, as we observed previously in young adults. In addition, older adults exhibited an overall reduction in both working-memory capacity and motor chunk length compared with that of young adults. However, individual variations in visuospatial working-memory capacity did not correlate with the rate of learning in older adults. These results indicate that working memory declines with age at least partially explain age-related differences in explicit motor sequence learning.},

These processes engage overlapping brain regions with sequence learning, but concrete evidence has been lacking. In this study, we determined whether limits in visuospatial working memory capacity and temporal control abilities affect the temporal organization of explicitly acquired motor sequences. Participants performed an explicit sequence learning task, a visuospatial working memory task, and a continuous tapping timing task. We found that visuospatial working memory capacity, but not the {CV} from the timing task, correlated with the rate of motor sequence learning and the chunking pattern observed in the learned sequence.

Proof-of-concept was established with a 2-degree-of-freedom {(DOF)} elbow/forearm manipulator. Tests of a second-generation therapy robot producing planar forearm movements in 19 hemiplegic and control subjects confirmed the validity and reliability of interaction forces during mechanically assisted upper-limb movements.

We have identified the following as the three most important unresolved issues: 1) an understanding of how {NMS} modifies the interactions within the nervous system, 2) clinical effectiveness of {NMS}, and 3) inexpensive, simple to insert and reliable controllable implanted systems. We discuss recent research aimed at resolving these issues and based on this we make some suggestions for future research. To resolve these issues we propose: 1) neurophysiologic research into the mechanism through which {NMS} interacts with the nervous system; 2) large multicenter randomized controlled trials using rigorous methodology that compare different applications of {NMs;} 3) continued technical development that is closely linked to clinical applications.},

@article{buetefisch_plasticity_2004,
	Abstract = {The adult brain maintains the ability for reorganization or plasticity throughout life. Results from neurophysiological and neuroanatomical experiments in animals and noninvasive neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies in humans show considerable plasticity of motor representations with use or nonuse, skill learning, or injury to the nervous system. An important concept of reorganization in the motor cortex is that of a distributed neuronal network in which multiple overlapping motor representations are functionally connected through an extensive horizontal network. By changing the strength of horizontal connections between motor neurons, functionally different neuronal assemblies can form, thereby providing a substrate to construct dynamic motor output zones. Modulation of inhibition and synaptic efficacy are mechanisms involved. Recent evidence from animal experiments indicates that these functional changes are accompanied by anatomical changes. Because plasticity of the brain plays a major role in the recovery of function after stroke, the knowledge of the principles of plasticity may help to design strategies to enhance plasticity when it is beneficial, such as after brain infarction.},

	Abstract = {Robotic training paradigms that enforce a fixed kinematic control might be suboptimal for rehabilitative training because they abolish variability, an intrinsic property of neuromuscular control {(Jezernik} et al., 2003). In the present study we introduce ``assist-as-needed'' {(AAN)} robotic training paradigms for rehabilitation of spinal cord injury subjects. To test the efficacy of these robotic control strategies to teach spinal mice to step, we divided 27 adult female {Swiss--Webster} mice randomly into three groups. Each group was trained robotically by using one of three control strategies: a fixed training trajectory {(Fixed} group), an {AAN} training paradigm without interlimb coordination {(Band} group), and an {AAN} training paradigm with bilateral hindlimb coordination {(Window} group). Beginning at 14 d after a complete midthoracic spinal cord transection, the mice were trained daily (10 min/d, 5 d/week) to step on a treadmill 10 min after the administration of quipazine (0.5 mg/kg), a serotonin agonist, for a period of 6 weeks. During weekly performance evaluations, the mice trained with the {AAN} window paradigm generally showed the highest level of recovery as measured by the number, consistency, and periodicity of steps during the testing sessions. In all three measurements there were no significant differences between the Band and the Fixed training groups. These results indicate that the window training approach, which includes loose alternating interlimb coordination, is more effective than a fixed trajectory paradigm with rigid alternating interlimb coordination or an {AAN} paradigm without any interlimb constraints in promoting robust postinjury stepping behavior.},

@article{cain_locomotor_2007,
	Abstract = {Background
We studied human locomotor adaptation to powered ankle-foot orthoses with the intent of identifying differences between two different orthosis control methods. The first orthosis control method used a footswitch to provide bang-bang control (a kinematic control) and the second orthosis control method used a proportional myoelectric signal from the soleus (a physiological control). Both controllers activated an artificial pneumatic muscle providing plantar flexion torque.

Methods
Subjects walked on a treadmill for two thirty-minute sessions spaced three days apart under either footswitch control (n = 6) or myoelectric control (n = 6). We recorded lower limb electromyography {(EMG)}, joint kinematics, and orthosis kinetics. We compared stance phase {EMG} amplitudes, correlation of joint angle patterns, and mechanical work performed by the powered orthosis between the two controllers over time.

Results
During steady state at the end of the second session, subjects using proportional myoelectric control had much lower soleus and gastrocnemius activation than the subjects using footswitch control. The substantial decrease in triceps surae recruitment allowed the proportional myoelectric control subjects to walk with ankle kinematics close to normal and reduce negative work performed by the orthosis. The footswitch control subjects walked with substantially perturbed ankle kinematics and performed more negative work with the orthosis.

Conclusion
These results provide evidence that the choice of orthosis control method can greatly alter how humans adapt to powered orthosis assistance during walking. Specifically, proportional myoelectric control results in larger reductions in muscle activation and gait kinematics more similar to normal compared to footswitch control.},

	Abstract = {We recorded motor-evoked potentials {(MEPs)} to transcranial magnetic stimulation from the right opponens pollicis {(OP)} muscle while participants observed an experimenter operating two types of pliers: pliers opened by the extension of the fingers and closed by their flexion (``normal pliers'') and pliers opened by the flexion of the fingers and closed by their extension (``reverse pliers''). In one experimental condition, the experimenter merely opened and closed the pliers; in the other, he grasped an object with them. In a further condition, the participants imagined themselves operating the normal and reverse pliers. During the observation of actions devoid of a goal, the {MEP} amplitudes, regardless of pliers used, reflected the muscular pattern involved in the execution of the observed action. In contrast, during the observation of goal-directed actions, the {MEPs} from {OP} were modulated by the action goal, increasing during goal achievement despite the opposite hand movements necessary to obtain it. During motor imagery, the {MEPs} recorded from {OP} reflected the muscular pattern required to perform the imagined action. We propose that covert activity in the human motor cortex may reflect different aspects of motor behavior. Imagining oneself performing tool actions or observing tool actions devoid of a goal activates the representation of the hand movements that correspond to the observed ones. In contrast, the observation of tool actions with a goal incorporates the distal part of the tool in the observer's body schema, resulting in a higher-order representation of the meaning of the motor act.},

@article{chen_nervous_2002,
	Abstract = {Contrary to the classical view of a pre-determined wiring pattern, there is considerable evidence that cortical representation of body parts is continuously modulated in response to activity, behavior and skill acquisition. Both animal and human studies showed that following injury of the peripheral nervous system such as nerve injury or amputation, the somatosensory cortex that responded to the deafferented body parts become responsive to neighboring body parts. Similarly, there is expansion of the motor representation of the stump area following amputation. Reorganization of the sensory and motor systems following peripheral injury occurs in multiple levels including the spinal cord, brainstem, thalamus and cortex. In early-blind subjects, the occipital cortex plays an important role in Braille reading, suggesting that there is cross-modal plasticity. Functional recovery frequently occurs following a {CNS} injury such as stroke. Motor recovery from stroke may be associated with the adjacent cortical areas taking over the function of the damaged areas or utilization of alternative motor pathways. The ipsilateral motor pathway may mediate motor recovery in patients who undergo hemispherectomy early in life and in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, but it remains to be determined if it plays a significant role in the recovery of adult stroke. One of the challenges in stroke recovery is to identify which of the many neuroimaging and neurophysiological changes demonstrated are important in mediating recovery. The mechanism of plasticity probably differs depending on the time frame. Rapid changes in motor representations within minutes are likely due to unmasking of latent synapses involving modulation of {GABAergic} inhibition. Changes over a longer time likely involve other additional mechanisms such as long-term potentiation, axonal regeneration and sprouting. While cross-modal plasticity appears to be useful in enhancing the perceptions of compensatory sensory modalities, the functional significance of motor reorganization following peripheral injury remains unclear and some forms of sensory reorganization may even be associated with deleterious consequences like phantom pain. An understanding of the mechanism of plasticity will help to develop treatment programs to improve functional outcome.},

@article{clark_re-inventing_2007,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience open up new vistas for human enhancement. Central to much of this work is the idea of new human-machine interfaces (in general) and new brain-machine interfaces (in particular). But despite the increasing prominence of such ideas, the very idea of such an interface remains surprisingly under-explored. In particular, the notion of human enhancement suggests an image of the embodied and reasoning agent as literally extended or augmented, rather than the more conservative image of a standard (non-enhanced) agent using a tool via some new interface. In this essay, I explore this difference, and attempt to lay out some of the conditions under which the more radical reading (positing brand new integrated agents or systemic wholes) becomes justified. I adduce some empirical evidence suggesting that the radical result is well within our scientific reach. The main reason why this is so has less to do with the advancement of our science (though that certainly helps) than with our native biological plasticity. We humans, I shall try to show, are biologically disposed towards literal (and repeated) episodes of sensory re-calibration, of bodily re-configuration and of mental extension. Such potential for literal and repeated re-configuration is the mark of what I shall call ``profoundly embodied agency,'' contrasting it with a variety of weaker (less philosophically and scientifically interesting) understandings of the nature and importance of embodiment for minds and persons. The article ends by relating the image of profound embodiment to some questions (and fears) concerning converging technologies for improving human performance.},

	Abstract = {Conventional approaches to haptic interface rely on high gain servos to implement virtual constraints. The role of the servo is to reduce the apparent degrees of freedom in such a way as to effectively constrain a human operator's motion. A significant drawback of this approach, however, is that the operator must interact directly with a high power system that is not inherently passive, and which may become unstable. In this paper, we present a novel approach to haptic display which allows virtual constraints to be implemented in a manner that is completely passive and therefore intrinsically safe. The key idea is to begin with a device having zero or one degree of freedom, and to use feedback control to increase the apparent degrees of freedom as necessary. This becomes possible with the use of nonholonomic joints, which have fewer degrees of freedom than generalized coordinates. The design and feedback control of several ``programmable constraint machines'' {(PCMs)} of this type are discussed},

@article{collins_recycling_2010,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Humans normally dissipate significant energy during walking, largely at the transitions between steps. The ankle then acts to restore energy during push-off, which may be the reason that ankle impairment nearly always leads to poorer walking economy. The replacement of lost energy is necessary for steady gait, in which mechanical energy is constant on average, external dissipation is negligible, and no net work is performed over a stride. However, dissipation and replacement by muscles might not be necessary if energy were instead captured and reused by an assistive device.


{METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

We developed a microprocessor-controlled artificial foot that captures some of the energy that is normally dissipated by the leg and "recycles" it as positive ankle work. In tests on subjects walking with an artificially-impaired ankle, a conventional prosthesis reduced ankle push-off work and increased net metabolic energy expenditure by 23\% compared to normal walking. Energy recycling restored ankle push-off to normal and reduced the net metabolic energy penalty to 14\%.


{CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE}

These results suggest that reduced ankle push-off contributes to the increased metabolic energy expenditure accompanying ankle impairments, and demonstrate that energy recycling can be used to reduce such cost.},

At the beginning of this training the leg movements of the patients have to be assisted by physiotherapists during gait on the moving treadmill. The physical capabilities and the individual experience of the therapists usually limit this training. A driven gait orthosis {(DGO)} has been developed that can move the legs of a patient in a physiological way on the moving treadmill. The orthosis is adjustable in size so different patients can use it. Actuators at the knee and hip joints are controlled by a position controller. With the {DGO} the legs of patients with different degrees of paresis and spasticity could be trained for more than half an hour, and physiological gait patterns were obtained.},

Setting: {ParaCare}, University Hospital Balgrist in Zurich, Switzerland. Methods: Treadmill training with manual assistance and by a driven gait orthosis was applied to two spinal cord injured patients. The first patient had an incomplete lesion at C3, the second a complete lesion at C5. They were selected by convenience sample. The {EMG} activity of the leg muscles rectus femoris, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medials {(GM)} and tibialis anterior {(TA)} was visually compared for the two training methods. {GM} and {TA} activity was also quantified by calculating the variation ratio between the {EMG} of the patients and a set of healthy subjects. Results: No significant difference between the two training methods was found according to the leg muscle {EMG} activity. Conclusion: Neuronal centers in the spinal cord become activated in a similar way by the manually assisted and the automated locomotor training. With the driven gait orthosis training sessions can be prolonged and workload of therapists can be reduced, and therefore, the automated training represents an alternative to the conventional therapy.},

@article{damoiseaux_consistent_2006,
	Abstract = {Functional {MRI} {(fMRI)} can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent {(BOLD)} signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting {fMRI} have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state {fMRI} data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the {BOLD} amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with {BOLD} signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage {BOLD} signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage {BOLD} signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

	Abstract = {de Leon, R. D., J. A. Hodgson, R. R. Roy, and V. R. Edgerton. Locomotor capacity attributable to step training versus spontaneous recovery after spinalization in adult cats. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 1329--1340, 1998. Locomotor performance, hindlimb muscle activity and gait patterns during stepping were studied in step-trained and non-trained female, adult spinal cats. Changes in locomotor characteristics relative to prespinalization bipedal and quadrupedal stepping patterns were used to evaluate the effects of step training on the capacity to execute full weight-bearing stepping after spinalization. Step training consisted of full weight-bearing stepping of the hindlimbs at the greatest range of treadmill speeds possible at any given stage of locomotor recovery. In the initial stages of training the limbs were assisted as needed to execute successful steps. On the basis of two behavioral criteria, the maximum speed of treadmill stepping and the number of successful steps per unit time, the ability to step was at least 3 times greater in animals trained to step versus those allowed to recover spontaneously, i.e., the non-trained. The greater success in stepping was reflected in several physiological and kinematic properties. For example, the amplitude of electromyograph {(EMG)} bursts in the tibialis anterior (an ankle dorsiflexor), the amount of extension at the end of both the stance {(E3)} and swing {(E1)} phases of the step cycle, and the amount of lift of the hindlimb during swing were greater in step-trained than in non-trained spinal cats. The changes that occurred in response to training reflected functional adaptations at specific phases of the step cycle, e.g., enhanced flexor and extensor function. The improved stepping capacity attributable to step training is interpreted as a change in the probability of the appropriate neurons being activated in a temporally appropriate manner. This interpretation, in turn, suggests that step training facilitated or reinforced the function of extant sensorimotor pathways rather than promoting the generation of additional pathways. These results show that the capacity of the adult lumbar spinal cord to generate full weight-bearing stepping over a range of speeds is defined, in large part, by the functional experience of the spinal cord after supraspinal connectivity has been eliminated. These results have obvious implications with regards to 1) the possibility of motor learning occurring in the spinal cord; 2) the importance of considering ``motor experience'' in assessing the effect of any postspinalization intervention; and 3) the utilization of use-dependent interventions in facilitating and enhancing motor recovery.},

@article{de_leon_full_1998,
	Abstract = {Behavioral and physiological characteristics of standing were studied in nontrained spinal cats and in spinal cats that received daily stand training of the hindlimbs for 12 wk. Training consisted of assisting the cats to stand with full weight support either on both hindlimbs or on one hindlimb (30 min/day, 5 days/wk). Extensor muscle electromyographic {(EMG)} amplitude and extension at the knee and ankle joints during full weight bearing recovered to prespinal levels in both stand-trained and nontrained spinal cats. However, full weight bearing of the hindquarters was sustained for up to approximately 20 min in the spinal cats that received bilateral stand training compared with approximately 4 min in cats that were not trained to stand. Unilateral stand training selectively improved weight bearing on the trained limb based on ground reaction forces and extensor muscle {EMG} activity levels measured during bilateral standing. These results suggest that the capacity of the adult lumbar spinal cord to generate full weight-bearing standing can be improved by as much as fivefold by the repetitive activation of selected neural pathways in the spinal cord after supraspinal connectivity has been eliminated. Given that stepping is improved in response to step training, it appears that the recovery of standing provides another example of training-specific motor learning in the spinal cord, i.e., the spinal cord learns to perform hindlimb standing by practicing that specific task.},

@article{diedrichsen_use-dependent_2010,
	Abstract = {Human motor behavior is constantly adapted through the process of error-based learning. When the motor system encounters an error, its estimate about the body and environment will change, and the next movement will be immediately modified to counteract the underlying perturbation. Here, we show that a second mechanism, use-dependent learning, simultaneously changes movements to become more similar to the last movement. In three experiments, participants made reaching movements toward a horizontally elongated target, such that errors in the initial movement direction did not have to be corrected. Along this task-redundant dimension, we were able to induce use-dependent learning by passively guiding movements in a direction angled by 8$\,^{\circ}$ from the previous direction. In a second study, we show that error-based and use-dependent learning can change motor behavior simultaneously in opposing directions by physically constraining the direction of active movements. After removal of the constraint, participants briefly exhibit an error-based aftereffect against the direction of the constraint, followed by a longer-lasting use-dependent aftereffect in the direction of the constraint. In the third experiment, we show that these two learning mechanisms together determine the solution the motor system adopts when learning a motor task.},

Unlike conventional human-powered generators that use positive muscle work, our technology assists muscles in performing negative work, analogous to regenerative braking in hybrid cars, where energy normally dissipated during braking drives a generator instead. The energy harvester mounts at the knee and selectively engages power generation at the end of the swing phase, thus assisting deceleration of the joint. Test subjects walking with one device on each leg produced an average of 5 watts of electricity, which is about 10 times that of shoe-mounted devices. The cost of harvesting-the additional metabolic power required to produce 1 watt of electricity-is less than one-eighth of that for conventional human power generation. Producing substantial electricity with little extra effort makes this method well-suited for charging powered prosthetic limbs and other portable medical devices.},

Studies were performed analyzing the feasibility of using shoulder elevation-depression and protraction-retraction as prosthesis control inputs. The results of this study showed that a prosthesis mechanism with nonlimiting dynamic response characteristics and shoulder-activated {EPP} control of wrist rotation and elbow flexion/extension, exhibited functional characteristics comparable to those of the physiological elbow and wrist as defined by tracking capabilities.

	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Manual body weight supported treadmill training and robot-aided treadmill training are frequently used techniques for the gait rehabilitation of individuals after stroke and spinal cord injury. Current evidence suggests that robot-aided gait training may be improved by making robotic behavior more patient-cooperative. In this study, we have investigated the immediate effects of patient-cooperative versus non-cooperative robot-aided gait training on individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury {(iSCI).}


{METHODS}

Eleven patients with {iSCI} participated in a single training session with the gait rehabilitation robot Lokomat. The patients were exposed to four different training modes in random order: During both non-cooperative position control and compliant impedance control, fixed timing of movements was provided. During two variants of the patient-cooperative path control approach, free timing of movements was enabled and the robot provided only spatial guidance. The two variants of the path control approach differed in the amount of additional support, which was either individually adjusted or exaggerated. Joint angles and torques of the robot as well as muscle activity and heart rate of the patients were recorded. Kinematic variability, interaction torques, heart rate and muscle activity were compared between the different conditions.


{RESULTS}

Patients showed more spatial and temporal kinematic variability, reduced interaction torques, a higher increase of heart rate and more muscle activity in the patient-cooperative path control mode with individually adjusted support than in the non-cooperative position control mode. In the compliant impedance control mode, spatial kinematic variability was increased and interaction torques were reduced, but temporal kinematic variability, heart rate and muscle activity were not significantly higher than in the position control mode.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Patient-cooperative robot-aided gait training with free timing of movements made individuals with {iSCI} participate more actively and with larger kinematic variability than non-cooperative, position-controlled robot-aided gait training.},

@article{edgerton_retraining_2001,
	Abstract = {The present review presents a series of concepts that may be useful in developing rehabilitative strategies to enhance recovery of posture and locomotion following spinal cord injury. First, the loss of supraspinal input results in a marked change in the functional efficacy of the remaining synapses and neurons of intraspinal and peripheral afferent (dorsal root ganglion) origin. Second, following a complete transection the lumbrosacral spinal cord can recover greater levels of motor performance if it has been exposed to the afferent and intraspinal activation patterns that are associated with standing and stepping. Third, the spinal cord can more readily reacquire the ability to stand and step following spinal cord transection with repetitive exposure to standing and stepping. Fourth, robotic assistive devices can be used to guide the kinematics of the limbs and thus expose the spinal cord to the new normal activity patterns associated with a particular motor task following spinal cord injury. In addition, such robotic assistive devices can provide immediate quantification of the limb kinematics. Fifth, the behavioural and physiological effects of spinal cord transection are reflected in adaptations in most, if not all, neurotransmitter systems in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Evidence is presented that both the {GABAergic} and glycinergic inhibitory systems are up-regulated following complete spinal cord transection and that step training results in some aspects of these transmitter systems being down-regulated towards control levels. These concepts and observations demonstrate that (a) the spinal cord can interpret complex afferent information and generate the appropriate motor task; and (b) motor ability can be defined to a large degree by training.},

@article{edgerton_plasticity_2004,
	Abstract = {Motor function is severely disrupted following spinal cord injury {(SCI).} The spinal circuitry, however, exhibits a great degree of automaticity and plasticity after an injury. Automaticity implies that the spinal circuits have some capacity to perform complex motor tasks following the disruption of supraspinal input, and evidence for plasticity suggests that biochemical changes at the cellular level in the spinal cord can be induced in an activity-dependent manner that correlates with sensorimotor recovery. These characteristics should be strongly considered as advantageous in developing therapeutic strategies to assist in the recovery of locomotor function following {SCI.} Rehabilitative efforts combining locomotor training pharmacological means and/or spinal cord electrical stimulation paradigms will most likely result in more effective methods of recovery than using only one intervention.},

@inproceedings{emken_robotic_2005,
	Abstract = {One of the prevailing paradigms of physical rehabilitation following neurologic injury is to "assist-as-needed"; that is, the rehabilitation therapist manually assists patients in performing movements, providing only as much assistance as needed to complete the movement. Several research groups are attempting to automate this principle with robotic movement training devices. This paper derives an "assist as needed" robotic training algorithm by framing the problem as an optimization problem. We assume that motor recovery can be modeled as a process of learning a novel sensory motor transformation. The optimized robotic movement trainer is then an error-based controller with a forgetting factor. It bounds kinematic errors while systematically reducing its assistance. The same controller also works well if the dominant dynamics of recovery are akin to a strengthening process. We experimentally validate the controller with an unimpaired subject by demonstrating how the controller can help the subject to learn a novel sensory motor transformation (i.e. an internal model) with smaller kinematic errors than typical. The task studied here is walking on a treadmill in the presence of a novel dynamic environment. The assist-as-needed controller proposed here may be useful for limiting error during the learning of tasks in which large errors are dangerous or discouraging.},

	Abstract = {Robotic gait training is an emerging technique for retraining walking ability following spinal cord injury {(SCI).} A key challenge in this training is determining an appropriate stepping trajectory and level of assistance for each patient, since patients have a wide range of sizes and impairment levels. Here, we demonstrate how a lightweight yet powerful robot can record subject-specific, trainer-induced leg trajectories during manually assisted stepping, then immediately replay those trajectories. Replay of the subject-specific trajectories reduced the effort required by the trainer during manual assistance, yet still generated similar patterns of muscle activation for six subjects with a chronic {SCI.} We also demonstrate how the impedance of the robot can be adjusted on a step-by-step basis with an error-based, learning law. This impedance-shaping algorithm adapted the robot's impedance so that the robot assisted only in the regions of the step trajectory where the subject consistently exhibited errors. The result was that the subjects stepped with greater variability, while still maintaining a physiologic gait pattern. These results are further steps toward tailoring robotic gait training to the needs of individual patients.},

@article{emken_motor_2007,
	Abstract = {Motor adaptation to a novel dynamic environment is primarily thought of as a process in which the nervous system learns to anticipate the environmental forces to eliminate kinematic error. Here we show that motor adaptation can more generally be modeled as a process in which the motor system greedily minimizes a cost function that is the weighted sum of kinematic error and effort. The learning dynamics predicted by this minimization process are a linear, auto-regressive equation with only one state, which has been identified previously as providing a good fit to data from force-field-type experiments. Thus we provide a new theoretical result that shows how these previously identified learning dynamics can be viewed as arising from an optimization of error and effort. We also show that the coefficients of the learning dynamics must fall within a specific range for the optimization model to be valid and verify with experimental data from walking in a force field that they indeed fall in this range. Finally, we attempted to falsify the model by performing experiments in two conditions (repeated exposure to a force field, exposure to force fields of different strengths) for which the single-state, auto-regressive equation might be expected to not fit the data well. We found however that the equation adequately captured the pattern of errors and thus conclude that motor adaptation to a force field can be approximated as an optimization of effort and error for a range of experimental conditions.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the changes of resource demand during the acquisition of a sensorimotor skill, namely the tracking of a visual target under reversed visual feedback. This acquisition task was performed alone or concurrently with one of four manual reaction-time tasks as loading tasks, designed to tap different computational resources. As expected, we found tracking performance to deteriorate upon vision reversal and then to gradually improve with practice. We further found that acquisition task and loading task interfered little before vision reversal but substantially afterwards. Most importantly, we observed a different time-course of interference for each of our four loading tasks. The particular pattern led us to conclude that resources related to spatial attention and sensory transformations are in highest demand early during skill acquisition and those pertinent to movement preparation somewhat later. Our findings thus provide experimental support for the theory that motor learning progresses in stages characterized by different resource requirements.},

Objective: To examine whether robotic therapy can reduce motor impairment and enhance recovery of the hemiparetic arm in persons with chronic stroke. Design: Pre-posttest design. Setting: Rehabilitation hospital, outpatient care. Participants: Volunteer sample of 20 persons diagnosed with a single, unilateral stroke within the past 1 to 5 years, with persistent hemiparesis. Interventions: Robotic therapy was provided 3 times weekly for 6 weeks. Subjects able to reach robot targets were randomly assigned to sensorimotor or progressive-resistive robotic therapy groups. Robotic therapy consisted of goal-directed, planar reaching tasks to exercise the hemiparetic shoulder and elbow. Main Outcome Measures: The Modified Ashworth Scale, {Fugl-Meyer} test of upper-extremity function, Motor Status Scale {(MSS)} score, and Medical Research Council motor power score. Results: Evaluations by a single blinded therapist revealed statistically significant gains from admission to discharge {(P[lt].05)} on the {Fugl-Meyer} test, {MSS} score, and motor power score. Secondary analyses revealed group differences: the progressive-resistive therapy group experienced nonspecific improvements on wrist and hand {MSS} scores that were not observed in the sensorimotor group. Conclusions: Robotic therapy may complement other treatment approaches by reducing motor impairment in persons with moderate to severe chronic impairments.},

This is due to its use of infinitely variable transmissions. While admittance displays typically excel at rendering high impedances, the incorporation of infinitely variable transmissions in the Cobotic Hand Controller allows the stable display of a wide dynamic range, including low impedances. The existence of a display that excels at rendering high-impedance constraints, but has high-fidelity control of low impedances tangent to those constraints, has led us to describe an admittance control architecture not often examined in the haptics community. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive approach that enables rendering of rigid motion constraints while simultaneously preserving the physical integrity of the intended inertial dynamics tangent to those constraints. This is in contrast to conventional impedance-control algorithms that focus primarily on rendering reaction forces along contact normals with constraints. We present this algorithm here, which is general to all admittance displays, and report on its implementation with the Cobotic Hand Controller.

One artificial pneumatic muscle provided plantar flexion torque and the second one provided dorsiflexion torque. Computer software adjusted air pressure in each artificial muscle independently so that artificial muscle force was proportional to rectified low-pass-filtered electromyography {(EMG)} amplitude (i.e., proportional myoelectric control). Tibialis anterior {EMG} activated the artificial dorsiflexor and soleus {EMG} activated the artificial plantar flexor. We collected joint kinematic and artificial muscle force data as one healthy participant walked on a treadmill with the orthosis. Peak plantar flexor torque provided by the orthosis was 70 Nm, and peak dorsiflexor torque provided by the orthosis was 38 Nm. The orthosis could be useful for basic science studies on human locomotion or possibly for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury.},

	Abstract = {Bimanual actions involve coordinated motion but often rely on the movements performed with each hand to be different. Older adults exhibit differentially greater variability for bimanual actions in which each hand has an independent movement goal. Such actions rely on interhemispheric communication via the corpus callosum, including both facilitatory and inhibitory interactions. Here, we investigated whether age differences in callosal structure and interhemispheric function contribute to this selective movement difficulty. Participants performed 3 force production tasks: 1) unimanual, 2) bimanual simultaneous, and 3) bimanual independent. Older adults had significantly greater interhemispheric facilitation during voluntary muscle activation. We also report a fundamental shift with age in the relationship between callosal tract microstructural integrity and interhemispheric inhibition {(IHI).} Specifically, older adults with relatively greater callosal tract microstructural integrity have less {IHI.} Furthermore, greater {IHI} was related to poorer bimanual performance (assessed by dominant hand force variability) in older adults on all tasks, whereas this relationship was only observed in young adults for the bimanual independent condition. These findings indicate changes in interhemispheric communication with advancing age such that older adults may rely on bilateral cortical cooperation to a greater extent than young adults for manual actions.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated neuroanatomically selective relationships among white matter tract microstructure, physiological function, and task performance. Such findings suggest that the microstructure of transcallosal motor fibers may reflect the capacity for interhemispheric inhibition between the primary motor cortices, although full characterization of the transcallosal inhibitory sensorimotor network is lacking. Thus, the goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive description of transcallosal fibers connecting homologous sensorimotor cortical regions and to identify the relationship(s) between fiber tract microstructure and interhemispheric inhibition during voluntary cortical activity. To this end, we assessed microstructure of fiber tracts connecting homologous sensorimotor regions of the cortex with diffusion tensor imaging. We also assessed interhemispheric inhibition by eliciting the ipsilateral silent period {(iSP)} within the same participants. We mapped mutually exclusive transcallosal connections between homologous sensorimotor regions and computed quantitative metrics of each fiber tract. Paralleling work in non-human primates, we found the densest interhemispheric sensorimotor connections to be between the medial motor areas. Additionally, we provide a midsagittal callosal atlas in normalized Montreal Neurological Institute {(MNI)} space for future studies to use when investigating callosal fiber tracts connecting primary and secondary sensorimotor cortices. Finally, we report a strong, positive relationship (r = 0.76) between strength of interhemispheric inhibition {(iSP)} and microstructure of interhemispheric fibers that is specific to tracts connecting the primary motor cortices. Thus, increased fiber microstructure in young adults predicts interhemispheric inhibitory capacity. Hum Brain Mapp , 2011. {\copyright} 2011 {Wiley-Liss}, Inc.},

Athletes who use tools as part of their practice may be an excellent model for assessing the neural correlates of possible bodily representation changes that are specific to extensive practice. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure corticospinal excitability in forearm and hand muscles of expert tennis players and novices while they mentally practiced a tennis forehand, table tennis forehand, and a golf drive. The muscles of expert tennis players showed increased corticospinal facilitation during motor imagery of tennis but not golf or table tennis. Novices, although athletes, were not modulated across sports. Subjective reports indicated that only in the tennis imagery condition did experts differ from novices in the ability to form proprioceptive images and to consider the tool as an extension of the hand. Neurophysiological and subjective data converge to suggest a key role of long-term experience in modulating sensorimotor body representations during mental simulation of sports.},

	Abstract = {Research into the development of brain-machine interfaces {(BMIs)} has led to demonstrations of rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans controlling prosthetic devices in real time through modulation of neural signals. In particular, cortical {BMI} studies have shown that improvements in performance require learning and are associated with changes in neuronal tuning properties. These studies have further shown evidence of long-term improvements in performance with practice. The authors conducted experiments to understand long-term skill acquisition with {BMIs} and to characterize the neural correlates of improvements in task performance. They specifically assessed long-term acquisition of neuroprosthetic skill (i.e., accurate task performance readily recalled across days). In 2 monkeys performing a center-out task using a brain-controlled {(BC)} computer cursor, they closely monitored daily performance trends and the neural correlates under different conditions. Importantly, they assessed {BC} performance using a continuous-control multistep task. The authors first conducted experiments that mimicked experimental conditions commonly used. Specifically, a large set of neurons was incorporated with daily recalibration of the transform of neural activity to {BC.} Under such conditions, they found evidence of variable daily performance. In contrast, when a fixed transform was applied to stable recordings from an ensemble of neurons across days, there was consistent evidence of long-term skill acquisition. Such skill acquisition was associated with the crystallization of a cortical map for prosthetic control. Taken together, the results suggest that the primate motor cortex can achieve skilled control of a neuroprosthetic device through consolidation of a cortical representation.},

We are using a motorized elbow brace to feed back grasp forces to the user in the form of extension torques about the elbow. This force display complements myoelectric control of grip closure in which {EMG} signals are drawn from the biceps muscle. We expect that the action/reaction coupling experienced by the biceps muscle will produce an intuitive paradigm for object manipulation, and we hope to uncover neural correlates to support this hypothesis. In this paper we present results from an experiment in which 7 able-bodied persons attempted to distinguish three objects by stiffness while grasping them under myoelectric control and feeling reaction forces displayed to their elbow. In four conditions (with and without force display, and using biceps myoelectric signals ipsilateral and contralateral to the force display,) ability to correctly identify objects was significantly increased with sensory feedback.},

@article{gillespie_kinematic_2002,
	Abstract = {Two continuously variable transmissions are examined, one that relates a pair of linear speeds and another that relates a pair of angular speeds. These devices are elemental in the design of cobots, a new class of robot that creates virtual guiding surfaces to aid a human operator in assembly tasks. Both of these transmissions are traction drive mechanisms that rely on the support of either lateral or longitudinal forces across rolling contacts with spin. When a rolling contact between elastic bodies or even between rigid bodies in spin is called upon to transmit a tractive force, kinematic creep develops, expressing a departure from the intended rolling constraint. Creep in turn gives rise to nonideal properties in a cobot's virtual guiding surfaces. This paper develops simple models of the two transmissions by expressing the relative velocity field in the contact patch between rolling bodies in terms of creep and spin. Coulomb friction laws are applied in a quasi-static analysis to produce complete force-motion models. These models may be used to evaluate a cobot's ability to support forces against its virtual guiding surfaces},

The {Fugl-Meyer} scale was developed as the first quantitative evaluative instrument for measuring sensorimotor stroke recovery, based on Twitchell and Brunnstrom's concept of sequential stages of motor return in the hemiplegic stroke patient. The {Fugl-Meyer} is a well-designed, feasible and efficient clinical examination method that has been tested widely in the stroke population. Its primary value is the 100-point motor domain, which has received the most extensive evaluation. Excellent interrater and intrarater reliability and construct validity have been demonstrated, and preliminary evidence suggests that the {Fugl-Meyer} assessment is responsive to change. Limitations of the motor domain include a ceiling effect, omission of some potentially relevant items, and weighting of the arm more than the leg. Further study should test performance of this scale in specific subgroups of stroke patients and better define its criterion validity, sensitivity to change, and minimal clinically important difference. Based on the available evidence, the {Fugl-Meyer} motor scale is recommended highly as a clinical and research tool for evaluating changes in motor impairment following stroke.},

	Abstract = {Proprioceptive information from the foot/ankle provides important information regarding body sway for balance control, especially in situations where visual information is degraded or absent. Given known increases in catastrophic injury due to falls with older age, understanding the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control is particularly important for older adults. In the present study, we linked neural activity in response to stimulation of key foot proprioceptors (i.e., muscle spindles) with balance ability across the lifespan. Twenty young and 20 older human adults underwent proprioceptive mapping; foot tendon vibration was compared with vibration of a nearby bone in an {fMRI} environment to determine regions of the brain that were active in response to muscle spindle stimulation. Several body sway metrics were also calculated for the same participants on an eyes-closed balance task. Based on regression analyses, multiple clusters of voxels were identified showing a significant relationship between muscle spindle stimulation-induced neural activity and maximum center of pressure excursion in the anterior--posterior direction. In this case, increased activation was associated with greater balance performance in parietal, frontal, and insular cortical areas, as well as structures within the basal ganglia. These correlated regions were age- and foot-stimulation side-independent and largely localized to right-sided areas of the brain thought to be involved in monitoring stimulus-driven shifts of attention. These findings support the notion that, beyond fundamental peripheral reflex mechanisms, central processing of proprioceptive signals from the foot is critical for balance control.},

	Abstract = {We used a lower limb robotic exoskeleton controlled by the wearer's muscle activity to study human locomotor adaptation to disrupted muscular coordination. Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects' gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by approximately 35\% and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation.},

The orthosis generated approximately 57\% of the peak ankle plantar flexor torque during stance and performed approximately 70\% of the positive plantar flexor work done during normal walking. Artificial muscle bandwidth and force-length properties were the two primary factors limiting torque production. The lack of peak force and work differences between single and double muscle conditions can be explained by force-length properties. Subjects altered their ankle kinematics between conditions resulting in changes in artificial muscle length. In the double muscle condition greater plantar flexion yielded shorter artificial muscles lengths and decreased muscle forces. This finding emphasizes the importance of human testing in the design and development of robotic exoskeleton devices for assisting human movement. The results of this study outline the mechanical performance limitations of an ankle-foot orthosis powered by artificial pneumatic muscles. This orthosis could be valuable for gait rehabilitation and for studies investigating neuromechanical control of human walking.},

	Abstract = {Human cognition has been shaped both by our body structure and by its complex interactions with its environment. Our cognition is thus inextricably linked to our own and others' motor behavior. To model brain activity associated with natural cognition, we propose recording the concurrent brain dynamics and body movements of human subjects performing normal actions. Here we tested the feasibility of such a mobile brain/body {(MoBI)} imaging approach by recording high-density electroencephalographic {(EEG)} activity and body movements of subjects standing or walking on a treadmill while performing a visual oddball response task. Independent component analysis of the {EEG} data revealed visual event-related potentials that during standing, slow walking, and fast walking did not differ across movement conditions, demonstrating the viability of recording brain activity accompanying cognitive processes during whole body movement. Non-invasive and relatively low-cost {MoBI} studies of normal, motivated actions might improve understanding of interactions between brain and body dynamics leading to more complete biological models of cognition.},

We apply results from complex analysis to prove that certain linear passive virtual environments cannot be rendered passively with a desired level of accuracy and over a given finite bandwidth. One practical consequence is that, under appropriate hypotheses, passivity will be violated when accurately rendering inertia in a virtual environment that is less than the inertia of the uncompensated hardware dynamics. In a related result, we show that there exists a waterbed-type tradeoff between performance and phase lag in the rendered dynamics. Both design constraints arise from feedback-bandwidth limitations and not sampled-data effects, quantization, or nonlinearities. The key to our analysis is an interpretation of a Bode gain-phase integral relationship that relates magnitude at low frequencies to phase at high frequencies. The performance limitation and the waterbed tradeoff are illustrated through an experimental study.},

	Abstract = {Biped robots form a subclass of legged or walking robots. The study of mechanical legged motion has been motivated by its potential use as a means of locomotion in rough terrain, as well as its potential benefits to prothesis development and testing. The paper concentrates on issues related to the automatic control of biped robots. More precisely, its primary goal is to contribute a means to prove asymptotically-stable walking in planar, underactuated biped robot models. Since normal walking can be viewed as a periodic solution of the robot model, the method of Poincare sections is the natural means to study asymptotic stability of a walking cycle. However, due to the complexity of the associated dynamic models, this approach has had limited success. The principal contribution of the present work is to show that the control strategy can be designed in a way that greatly simplifies the application of the method of Poincare to a class of biped models, and, in fact, to reduce the stability assessment problem to the calculation of a continuous map from a subinterval of R to itself. The mapping in question is directly computable from a simulation model. The stability analysis is based on a careful formulation of the robot model as a system with impulse effects and the extension of the method of Poincare sections to this class of models},

Meanwhile, in the {US}, the most advanced exoskeleton projects are currently underway at the University of California and at Sacros Research Corp.

@article{gupta_design_2008,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the design, control and performance of a high fidelity four degree-of-freedom wrist exoskeleton robot, {RiceWrist}, for training and rehabilitation. The {RiceWrist} is intended to provide kinesthetic feedback during the training of motor skills or rehabilitation of reaching movements. Motivation for such applications is based on findings that show robot-assisted physical therapy aids in the rehabilitation process following neurological injuries. The exoskeleton device accommodates forearm supination and pronation, wrist flexion and extension and radial and ulnar deviation in a compact parallel mechanism design with low friction, zero backlash and high stiffness. As compared to other exoskeleton devices, the {RiceWrist} allows easy measurement of human joint angles and independent kinesthetic feedback to individual human joints. In this paper, joint-space as well as task-space position controllers and an impedance-based force controller for the device are presented. The kinematic performance of the device is characterized in terms of its workspace, singularities, manipulability, backlash and backdrivability. The dynamic performance of {RiceWrist} is characterized in terms of motor torque output, joint friction, step responses, behavior under closed loop set-point and trajectory tracking control and display of virtual walls. The device is singularity-free, encompasses most of the natural workspace of the human joints and exhibits low friction, zero-backlash and high manipulability, which are kinematic properties that characterize a high-quality impedance display device. In addition, the device displays fast, accurate response under position control that matches human actuation bandwidth and the capability to display sufficiently hard contact with little coupling between controlled degrees-of-freedom.},

@article{gwin_electrocortical_2011,
	Abstract = {Recent findings suggest that human cortex is more active during steady-speed unperturbed locomotion than previously thought. However, techniques that have been used to image the brain during locomotion lack the temporal resolution necessary to assess intra-stride cortical dynamics. Our aim was to determine if electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography {(EEG)}, motion capture, and a force-measuring treadmill to record brain and body dynamics while eight healthy young adult subjects walked on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis {(ICA)} parsed {EEG} signals into maximally independent component {(IC)} processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources, and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current dipole for each {IC} using an inverse modeling approach, and clustered electrocortical sources across subjects by similarities in dipole locations and power spectra. We then computed spectrograms for each electrocortical source that were time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources in the anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex exhibited significant (p{\textless}0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral power. During the end of stance, as the leading foot was contacting the ground and the trailing foot was pushing off, alpha- and beta-band spectral power increased in or near the left/right sensorimotor and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Power increases in the left/right sensorimotor cortex were more pronounced for contralateral limb push-off (ipsilateral heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in steady-speed human locomotion. Future applications of these techniques could provide critical insight into the neural mechanisms of movement disorders and gait rehabilitation.},

@article{gwin_removal_2010,
	Abstract = {Although human cognition often occurs during dynamic motor actions, most studies of human brain dynamics examine subjects in static seated or prone conditions. {EEG} signals have historically been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from {EEG} signals recorded during walking and running. We first used stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density {EEG} recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent component analysis {(ICA)} to parse the channel-based noise reduced {EEG} signals into maximally independent components {(ICs)} and then performed component-based template regression. Applying channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact rejection significantly reduced {EEG} spectral power in the 1.5- to {8.5-Hz} frequency range during walking and running. In walking conditions, gait-related artifact was insubstantial: event-related potentials {(ERPs)}, which were nearly identical to visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible before and after applying noise reduction. In the running condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the {EEG} signals: stable average {ERP} time-courses of {IC} processes were only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that high-density {EEG} can be used to study brain dynamics during whole body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.},

@article{halsband_motor_2006,
	Abstract = {This chapter reviews results of clinical and functional imaging studies which investigated the time-course of cortical and subcortical activation during the acquisition of motor a skill. During the early phases of learning by trial and error, activation in prefrontal areas, especially in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, is has been reported. The role of these areas is presumably related to explicit working memory and the establishment of a novel association between visual cues and motor commands. Furthermore, motor associated areas of the right hemisphere and distributed cerebellar areas reveal strong activation during the early motor learning. Activation in superior-posterior parietal cortex presumably arises from visuospatial processes, while sensory feedback is coded in the anterior-inferior parietal cortex and the neocerebellar structures. With practice, motor associated areas of the left-hemisphere reveal increased activity. This shift to the left hemisphere has been observed regardless of the hand used during training, indicating a left-hemispheric dominance in the storage of visuomotor skills. Concerning frontal areas, learned actions of sequential character are represented in the caudal part of the supplementary motor area {(SMA} proper), whereas the lateral premotor cortex appears to be responsible for the coding of the association between visuo-spatial information and motor commands. Functional imaging studies which investigated the activation patterns of motor learning under implicit conditions identified for the first, a motor circuit which includes lateral premotor cortex and {SMA} proper of the left hemisphere and primary motor cortex, for the second, a cognitive loop which consists of basal ganglia structures of the right hemisphere. Finally, activity patterns of intermanual transfer are discussed. After right-handed training, activity in motor associated areas maintains during performance of the mirror version, but is increased during the performance of the original-oriented version with the left hand. In contrary, increased activity during the mirror reversed action, but not during the original-oriented performance of the untrained right hand is observed after left-handed training. These results indicate the transfer of acquired right-handed information which reflects the mirror symmetry of the body, whereas spatial information is mainly transferred after left-handed training. Taken together, a combined approach of clinical lesion studies and functional imaging is a promising tool for identifying the cerebral regions involved in the process of motor learning and provides insight into the mechanisms underlying the generalisation of actions.},

@article{han_stroke_2008,
	Abstract = {Motor training with the upper limb affected by stroke partially reverses the loss of cortical representation after lesion and has been proposed to increase spontaneous arm use. Moreover, repeated attempts to use the affected hand in daily activities create a form of practice that can potentially lead to further improvement in motor performance. We thus hypothesized that if motor retraining after stroke increases spontaneous arm use sufficiently, then the patient will enter a virtuous circle in which spontaneous arm use and motor performance reinforce each other. In contrast, if the dose of therapy is not sufficient to bring spontaneous use above threshold, then performance will not increase and the patient will further develop compensatory strategies with the less affected hand. To refine this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of bilateral hand use in arm reaching to study the interactions between adaptive decision making and motor relearning after motor cortex lesion. The model contains a left and a right motor cortex, each controlling the opposite arm, and a single action choice module. The action choice module learns, via reinforcement learning, the value of using each arm for reaching in specific directions. Each motor cortex uses a neural population code to specify the initial direction along which the contralateral hand moves towards a target. The motor cortex learns to minimize directional errors and to maximize neuronal activity for each movement. The derived learning rule accounts for the reversal of the loss of cortical representation after rehabilitation and the increase of this loss after stroke with insufficient rehabilitation. Further, our model exhibits nonlinear and bistable behavior: if natural recovery, motor training, or both, brings performance above a certain threshold, then training can be stopped, as the repeated spontaneous arm use provides a form of motor learning that further bootstraps performance and spontaneous use. Below this threshold, motor training is "in vain": there is little spontaneous arm use after training, the model exhibits learned nonuse, and compensatory movements with the less affected hand are reinforced. By exploring the nonlinear dynamics of stroke recovery using a biologically plausible neural model that accounts for reversal of the loss of motor cortex representation following rehabilitation or the lack thereof, respectively, we can explain previously hard to reconcile data on spontaneous arm use in stroke recovery. Further, our threshold prediction could be tested with an adaptive train-wait-train paradigm: if spontaneous arm use has increased in the "wait" period, then the threshold has been reached, and rehabilitation can be stopped. If spontaneous arm use is still low or has decreased, then another bout of rehabilitation is to be provided.},

Neurophysiol. 77: 797--811, 1997. Studies suggest that the human lumbosacral spinal cord can generate steplike oscillating electromyographic {(EMG)} patterns, but it remains unclear to what degree these efferent patterns depend on the phasic peripheral sensory information associated with bilateral limb movements and loading. We examined the role of sensory information related to lower-extremity weight bearing in modulating the efferent motor patterns of spinal-cord-injured {(SCI)} subjects during manually assisted stepping on a treadmill. Four nonambulatory subjects, each with a chronic thoracic spinal cord injury, and two nondisabled subjects were studied. The level of loading, {EMG} patterns, and kinematics of the lower limbs were studied during manually assisted or unassisted stepping on a treadmill with body weight support. The relationships among lumbosacral motor pool activity [soleus {(SOL)}, medial gastrocnemius {(MG)}, and tibialis anterior {(TA)]}, limb load, muscle-tendon length, and velocity of muscle-tendon length change were examined. The {EMG} mean amplitude of the {SOL}, {MG}, and {TA} was directly related to the peak load per step on the lower limb during locomotion. The effects on the {EMG} amplitude were qualitatively similar in subjects with normal, partial, or no detectable supraspinal input. Responses were most consistent in the {SOL} and {MG} at load levels of {\textless}50\% of a subject's body weight. The modulation of the {EMG} amplitude from the {SOL} and {MG}, both across steps and within a step, was more closely associated with limb peak load than muscle-tendon stretch or the velocity of muscle-tendon stretch. Thus stretch reflexes were not the sole source of the phasic {EMG} activity in flexors and extensors during manually assisted stepping in {SCI} subjects. The {EMG} amplitude within a step was highly dependent on the phase of the step cycle regardless of level of load. These data suggest that level of loading on the lower limbs provides cues that enable the human lumbosacral spinal cord to modulate efferent output in a manner that may facilitate the generation of stepping. These data provide a rationale for gait rehabilitation strategies that utilize the level of load-bearing stepping to enhance the locomotor capability of {SCI} subjects.},

To construct an advanced mechanized gait trainer to enable patients the repetitive practice of a gaitlike movement without overstraining therapists. {DEVICE:} Prototype gait trainer that simulates the phases of gait (by generating a ratio of 40\% to 60\% between swing and stance phases), supports the subjects according to their ability (lifts the foot during swing phase), and controls the center of mass in the vertical and horizontal directions.


{PATIENTS}

Two nonambulatory, hemiparetic patients who regained their walking ability after 4 weeks of daily training on the gait trainer, a 55-year-old woman and a 62-year-old man, both of whom had a first-time ischemic stroke.


{INTERVENTION}

Four weeks of training, five times a week, each session 20 minutes long.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Functional ambulation category {(FAC}, levels 0-5) to assess gait ability and ground level walking velocity. Rivermead motor assessment score {(RMAS}, 0-13) to assess gross motor function.


{RESULTS}

Patient 1: At the end of treatment, she was able to walk independently on level ground with use of a walking stick. Her walking velocity had improved from .29m/sec to .59m/sec. Her {RMAS} score increased from 4 to 10, meaning she could walk at least 40 meters outside, pick up objects from floor, and climb stairs independently. Patient 2: At end of 4-week training, he could walk independently on even surfaces {(FAC} level 4), using an ankle-foot orthosis and a walking stick. His walking velocity improved from .14m/sec to .63m/sec. His {RMAS} increased from 3 to 10.


{CONCLUSION}

The gait trainer enabled severely affected patients the repetitive practice of a gaitlike movement. Future studies may elucidate its value in gait rehabilitation of nonambulatory subjects.},

	Abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}

The successful motor rehabilitation of stroke, traumatic brain-injured and spinal cord-injured patients requires an intensive and task-specific therapy approach. Budget constraints limit a hand-to-hand therapy approach, so that intelligent machines may offer a solution to promote motor recovery and obtain a better understanding of motor control. This new field of automated or robot-assisted motor rehabilitation has emerged since the 1990s.


{RECENT} {FINDINGS}

This article will present clinically viable devices for upper and lower extremity rehabilitation. The {MIT-Manus} and the {Mirror-Image} Motion Enabler robot, which enable unrestricted unilateral or bilateral shoulder and elbow movement, consistently proved superior on the motor impairment level. The {ARM} guide, which assisted reaching in a straight-line trajectory, and the {Bi-Manu-Track}, which enabled the bilateral practice of a forearm and wrist movement, are currently being tested. For gait rehabilitation after stroke, the electromechanical gait trainer, {GT} I, has proved effective compared with treadmill training with body weight support. The Lokomat, consisting of a treadmill and a powered exoskeleton, lessened the therapeutic effort compared with manually assisted treadmill training in spinal cord-injured patients. Future developments will see more degrees of freedom, improved man-machine interaction and the implementation of virtual reality.


{SUMMARY}

Technical possibilities are one aspect, but multi-centre trials and a consideration of the unsubstantiated fears among therapists of being replaced by machines will decide on the successful implementation of this most promising field to the benefit of patients.},

	Abstract = {Objective. To compare the efficacy of robotic-assisted gait training with the Lokomat to conventional gait training in individuals with subacute stroke. Methods. A total of 63 participants {\textless}6 months poststroke with an initial walking speed between 0.1 to 0.6 m/s completed the multicenter, randomized clinical trial. All participants received twenty-four 1-hour sessions of either Lokomat or conventional gait training. Outcome measures were evaluated prior to training, after 12 and 24 sessions, and at a 3-month follow-up exam. Self-selected overground walking speed and distance walked in 6 minutes were the primary outcome measures, whereas secondary outcome measures included balance, mobility and function, cadence and symmetry, level of disability, and quality of life measures. Results. Participants who received conventional gait training experienced significantly greater gains in walking speed {(P} = .002) and distance {(P} = .03) than those trained on the Lokomat. These differences were maintained at the 3-month follow-up evaluation. Secondary measures were not different between the 2 groups, although a 2-fold greater improvement in cadence was observed in the conventional versus Lokomat group. Conclusions. For subacute stroke participants with moderate to severe gait impairments, the diversity of conventional gait training interventions appears to be more effective than robotic-assisted gait training for facilitating returns in walking ability.},

@article{huang_neural_2004,
	Abstract = {During gait rehabilitation, therapists or robotic devices often supply physical assistance to a patient's lower limbs to aid stepping. The expensive equipment and intensive manual labor required for these therapies limit their availability to patients. One alternative solution is to design devices where patients could use their upper limbs to provide physical assistance to their lower limbs (i.e., self-assistance). To explore potential neural effects of coupling upper and lower limbs, we investigated neuromuscular recruitment during self-driven and externally driven lower limb motion. Healthy subjects exercised on a recumbent stepper using different combinations of upper and lower limb exertions. The recumbent stepper mechanically coupled the upper and lower limbs, allowing users to drive the stepping motion with upper and/or lower limbs. We instructed subjects to step with 1) active upper and lower limbs at an easy resistance level (active arms and legs); 2) active upper limbs and relaxed lower limbs at easy, medium, and hard resistance levels (self-driven); and 3) relaxed upper and lower limbs while another person drove the stepping motion (externally driven). We recorded surface electromyography {(EMG)} from six lower limb muscles. Self-driven {EMG} amplitudes were always higher than externally driven {EMG} amplitudes {(P} {\textless} 0.05). As resistance and upper limb exertion increased, self-driven {EMG} amplitudes also increased. {EMG} bursts during self-driven and active arms and legs stepping occurred at similar times. These results indicate that active upper limb movement increases neuromuscular activation of the lower limbs during cyclic stepping motions. Neurologically impaired humans that actively engage their upper limbs during gait rehabilitation may increase neuromuscular activation and enhance activity-dependent plasticity.},

@article{huang_robotic_2009,
	Abstract = {Conventional neurorehabilitation appears to have little impact on impairment over and above that of spontaneous biological recovery. Robotic neurorehabilitation has the potential for a greater impact on impairment due to easy deployment, its applicability across of a wide range of motor impairment, its high measurement reliability, and the capacity to deliver high dosage and high intensity training protocols. We first describe current knowledge of the natural history of arm recovery after stroke and of outcome prediction in individual patients. Rehabilitation strategies and outcome measures for impairment versus function are compared. The topics of dosage, intensity, and time of rehabilitation are then discussed. Robots are particularly suitable for both rigorous testing and application of motor learning principles to neurorehabilitation. Computational motor control and learning principles derived from studies in healthy subjects are introduced in the context of robotic neurorehabilitation. Particular attention is paid to the idea of context, task generalization and training schedule. The assumptions that underlie the choice of both movement trajectory programmed into the robot and the degree of active participation required by subjects are examined. We consider rehabilitation as a general learning problem, and examine it from the perspective of theoretical learning frameworks such as supervised and unsupervised learning. We discuss the limitations of current robotic neurorehabilitation paradigms and suggest new research directions from the perspective of computational motor learning.},

@article{imamizu_cerebellar_2010,
	Abstract = {Humans have remarkable abilities in the dexterous use of tools to extend their physical capabilities. Although previous neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging studies have mainly focused on the contribution of frontal-parietal cerebral networks to skills for tool use, dense anatomical and functional connections are known to exist between the frontal-parietal regions and the lateral cerebellum, suggesting that the cerebellum also supports the information processing necessary for the dexterous use of tools. In this article, we review functional and structural imaging studies reporting that the cerebellum is related to the learning acquisition of neural mechanisms representing input-output properties of controlled objects, including tools. These studies also suggest that such mechanisms are modularly organized in the cerebellum corresponding to the different properties of objects, such as kinematic or dynamic properties and types of tools, and that they enable humans to flexibly cope with discrete changes in objects and environments by reducing interference and combining acquired modules. Based on these studies, we propose a hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to the skillful use of tools by representing the input-output properties of tools and providing information on the prediction of the sensory consequences of manipulation with the parietal regions, which are related to multisensory processing, and information on the necessary control of tools with the premotor regions, which contribute to the control of hand movements.},

@article{imamizu_modular_2003,
	Abstract = {Human capabilities in dexterously manipulating many different tools suggest modular neural organization at functional levels, but anatomical modularity underlying the capabilities has yet to be demonstrated. Although modularity in phylogenetically older parts of the cerebellum is well known, comparable modularity in the lateral cerebellum for cognitive functions remains unknown. We investigated these issues by functional {MRI} {(fMRI)} based on our previous findings of a cerebellar internal model of a tool. After subjects intensively learned to manipulate two novel tools (the rotated mouse whose cursor appeared at a rotated position, and the velocity mouse whose cursor velocity was proportional to the mouse position), they could easily switch between the two. The lateral and posterior cerebellar activities for the two different tools were spatially segregated, and their overlaps were {\textless}10\%, even at low statistical thresholds. Activities of the rotated mouse were more anterior and lateral than the velocity mouse activities. These results were consistent with predictions by the {MOdular} Selection And Identification Controller {(MOSAIC)} model that multiple internal models compete to partition sensory-motor experiences and their outputs are linearly combined for a particular context.},

@article{jacobsen_research_2004,
	Abstract = {Sarcos Research Corporation, and the Center for Engineering Design at the University of Utah, have long been interested in both the fundamental and the applied aspects of robots and other computationally driven machines. We have produced substantial numbers of systems that function as products for commercial applications, and as advanced research tools specifically designed for experimental use. This paper reviews various aspects of the design and control of a number of robot-like machines ranging from our first projects, the Utah Arm and the {Utah/MIT} Dextrous Hand, to present work on humanoid robots and the Wearable Energetically Autonomous Robot {(WEAR).} Our systems have been used in: entertainment, operator remotization from hazardous environments, {R\&D}, and medicine. In addition to the robots and their subsystems, extensive work has been devoted to command systems that drive the robots. Command systems have been: playback supervisors, teleoperation masters, and various higher level approaches based on work from the {AI} community. Playback interfaces have included motion capture mechanisms that provide movement-stream information to storage systems configured for later, repeated and coordinated, operation of many robots and associated mechanisms. Play-back command systems use human commands, from an ``earlier'' time, to command motions that are played out, over and over, mindlessly. Teleoperation ``masters'', that operate in real-time with the robot, have ranged from simple motion capture devices, to more complex force reflective exoskeletal masters. Teleoperation interfaces have been composed of complex kinematic structures designed to perform motions compatible with operator movements and are attached via appropriate soft tissue interfaces. The masters emit lower level commands (joint angles) in real-time using the natural intelligence and sensory systems of the operator. {AI-based} command sources, blend higher level (simple) commands, with system and existing environmental states, to make decisions for the management of the robot. As with the playback systems, {AI-based} systems are programmed earlier to perform later operations. In the {AI} case, however, adaptive intelligence and sensory capabilities reside in the robot. Our general design approach has been to begin with the definition of desired objective behaviors, rather than the use of available components with their predefined technical specifications. With the technical specifications of the components necessary to achieve the desired behaviors defined, the components are either acquired, or in most cases, developed and built. The control system, which includes the operation of feedback approaches, acting in collaboration with physical machinery, is then defined and implemented. Control is considered a function of both feedback, and the designed-in performance of the robot's physical machinery. It has not been true that bad performance from physical machine elements can be simply compensated out via innovative control methods and faster computers. After the completion of many projects we believe that the final frontier(s) of robotics reside at both ends of the brain and brawn spectrum. Both frontiers (barriers) are related to autonomy---intelligence/computation and energy/power. Recently, energetic autonomy has become a major interest at Sarcos and projects are underway to develop appropriate fuel-based servo-actuators to satisfy that need. Our objective is to develop power systems that are capable producing high performance servo-quality actuation for extended operating times without reenergizing the system. At the other end of the spectrum, we are working in collaboration with various groups to supply physical robots capable of operation under the control of advanced {AI-based} systems.},

The second one is based on direct dynamics and estimation of the desired variation in the gait-pattern acceleration. The third algorithm is based on impedance control and direct adaptation of the gait pattern angular trajectories. The algorithms were tested and compared in computer simulations and actual experiments on healthy subjects and patients. In simulations, all algorithms have adapted the gait pattern toward the desired one, which led to a greater than 40\% reduction of interaction torques.

Each subject in a group of normal subjects (n=10) was tested with eyes-open and eyes-closed with simultaneous but uncorrelated vestibular and proprioceptive stimuli in order to investigate the contributions of individual sensory feedback loops. Statistical analysis was made by means of multi-input multi-output identification of a transfer function from stimuli to stabilizing forces of the feet and the resulting body position, the transfer function being compatible with a biomechanical model formulated as a stabilized segmented inverted pendulum subject to feedback of body sway and position. Each individual model estimated is effective in predicting a subject's response to new stimuli and in describing the interacting effects of stimuli on body kinetics. The proposed methodology responds to the current needs of data analysis of multi-stimulus multi-response experiments.},

	Abstract = {The behaviors involved in complex human tool use cut across boundaries traditionally drawn between social, cognitive, perceptual and motor processes. Longstanding neuropsychological evidence suggests a distinction between brain systems responsible for representing: (1) semantic knowledge about familiar tools and their uses, and (2) the acquired skills necessary for performing these actions. Contemporary findings in functional neuroimaging support and refine this distinction by revealing the distributed neural systems that support these processes and the conditions under which they interact. Together, these findings indicate that behaviors associated with complex tool use arise from functionally specialized networks involving temporal, parietal and frontal areas within the left cerebral hemisphere.},

	Abstract = {During passive lower limb movement, active use of the upper limbs increases unintentional lower limb muscle activation. We hypothesized that faster movement frequencies would amplify lower limb muscle activation during upper limb exertion but would not affect lower limb muscle activation when the upper limbs were relaxed. We studied 10 healthy participants exercising on a recumbent stepping machine that mechanically coupled the four limbs via handles and pedals. Participants exercised at four frequencies (30, 60, 90, 120 steps/min) under four conditions of active and passive movement. Self-driven lower limb motion resulted in greater muscle activation compared to externally driven lower limb motion. Muscle activation amplitude increased with frequency for all conditions except for externally driven stepping. These results indicate that fast upper limb movement facilitates neuromuscular recruitment of lower limb muscles during stepping tasks. If a similar effect occurs in neurologically impaired individuals during active stepping, self-assisted exercise might enhance neuromuscular recruitment during rehabilitation.},

	Abstract = {A robotic ankle-foot orthosis {(AFO)} that provides powered assistance could adjust to varying gait dynamics much better than a rigid {AFO.} To provide insight into how humans would adapt to a powered {AFO}, we studied the response of neurologically intact subjects walking with an active dorsiflexion assist orthosis proportionally controlled by tibialis anterior electromyography {(EMG).} We examined the two mechanical functions of ankle dorsiflexors in gait (power absorption at heel strike and power generation at toe-off) by recruiting two groups of healthy subjects: Group One, called Continuous Control (n=5), had dorsiflexion assistance both at the initial heel contact and during swing; Group Two, called Swing Control (n=5), had the assistance only during swing. We hypothesized both groups of subjects would reduce tibialis anterior {EMG} amplitude with practice walking with the powered dorsiflexion assist. Ten healthy subjects were fitted with custom-made orthoses that included an artificial pneumatic muscle providing dorsiflexor torque. We collected lower body kinematics, {EMG}, and artificial muscle force while subjects walked on a treadmill for two 30-min training sessions. We found that subjects walked with increased ankle dorsiflexion by 9 degrees but showed different adaptation responses of the two tibialis anterior {EMG} bursts. The first {EMG} burst around heel strike had approximately 28\% lower amplitudes (p{\textless}0.05) but the second {EMG} burst during swing had similar amplitudes. These results provide baseline data of {EMG} controlled dorsiflexion assist in neurologically intact humans that can be used to guide future studies on neurologically impaired individuals.},

	Abstract = {To guide development of robotic lower limb exoskeletons, it is necessary to understand how humans adapt to powered assistance. The purposes of this study were to quantify joint moments while healthy subjects adapted to a robotic ankle exoskeleton and to determine if the period of motor adaptation is dependent on the magnitude of robotic assistance. The pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton provided plantar flexor torque controlled by the wearer's soleus electromyography {(EMG).} Eleven na{\"\i}ve individuals completed two 30-min sessions walking on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at 1.25m/s while wearing the ankle exoskeleton. After two sessions of practice, subjects reduced their soleus {EMG} activation by approximately 36\% and walked with total ankle moment patterns similar to their unassisted gait (r(2)=0.98+/-0.02, {THSD}, p{\textgreater}0.05). They had substantially different ankle kinematic patterns compared to their unassisted gait (r(2)=0.79+/-0.12, {THSD}, p{\textless}0.05). Not all of the subjects reached a steady-state gait pattern within the two sessions, in contrast to a previous study using a weaker robotic ankle exoskeleton {(Gordon} and Ferris, 2007). Our results strongly suggest that humans aim for similar joint moment patterns when walking with robotic assistance rather than similar kinematic patterns. In addition, greater robotic assistance provided during initial use results in a longer adaptation process than lesser robotic assistance.},

	Abstract = {During human walking, plantar flexor activation in late stance helps to generate a stable and economical gait pattern. Because plantar flexor activation is highly mediated by proprioceptive feedback, the nervous system must modulate reflex pathways to meet the mechanical requirements of gait. The purpose of this study was to quantify ankle joint mechanical output of the plantar flexor stretch reflex response during a novel unexpected gait perturbation. We used a robotic ankle exoskeleton to mechanically amplify the ankle torque output resulting from soleus muscle activation. We recorded lower-body kinematics, ground reaction forces, and electromyography during steady-state walking and during randomly perturbed steps when the exoskeleton assistance was unexpectedly turned off. We also measured soleus Hoffmann- {(H-)} reflexes at late stance during the two conditions. Subjects reacted to the unexpectedly decreased exoskeleton assistance by greatly increasing soleus muscle activity about 60ms after ankle angle deviated from the control condition (p{\textless}0.001). There were large differences in ankle kinematic and electromyography patterns for the perturbed and control steps, but the total ankle moment was almost identical for the two conditions (p=0.13). The ratio of soleus H-reflex amplitude to background electromyography was not significantly different between the two conditions (p=0.4). This is the first study to show that the nervous system chooses reflex responses during human walking such that invariant ankle joint moment patterns are maintained during perturbations. Our findings are particularly useful for the development of neuromusculoskeletal computer simulations of human walking that need to adjust reflex gains appropriately for biomechanical analyses.},

These concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. In particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. The 'minimum variance model' is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. This model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.},

	Abstract = {Many places in the world are too rugged or enclosed for vehicles to access. Even today, material transport to such areas is limited to manual labor and beasts of burden. Modern advancements in wearable robotics may make those methods obsolete. Lower extremity exoskeletons seek to supplement the intelligence and sensory systems of a human with the significant strength and endurance of a pair of wearable robotic legs that support a payload. This article first outlines the use of Clinical Gait Analysis data as the framework for the design of such a system at {UC} Berkeley. This data is used to design the exoskeleton degrees of freedom and size its actuators. It will then give an overview of one of the control schemes implemented on the {BLEEX.} The control algorithm described here increases the system closed loop sensitivity to its wearer's forces and torques without any measurement from the wearer (such as force, position, or electromyogram signal). The control algorithm uses the inverse dynamics of the exoskeleton, scaled by a number smaller than unity, as a positive feedback controller. This controller almost destabilizes the system since it leads to an overall loop gain slightly smaller than unity and results in a large sensitivity to all wearer's forces and torques thereby allowing the exoskeleton to shadow its wearer.},

	Abstract = {The Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton is the first functional energetically autonomous load carrying human exoskeleton and was demonstrated at {U.C.} Berkeley, walking at the average speed of 0.9 m/s (2 mph) while carrying a 34 kg (75 lb) payload. The original published controller, called the {BLEEX} Sensitivity Amplification Controller, was based on positive feedback and was designed to increase the closed loop system sensitivity to its wearer's forces and torques without any direct measurement from the wearer. This controller was successful at allowing natural and unobstructed load support for the pilot. This article presents an improved control scheme we call ``hybrid'' {BLEEX} control that adds robustness to changing {BLEEX} backpack payload. The walking gait cycle is divided into stance control and swing control phases. Position control is used for the {BLEEX} stance leg (including the torso and backpack) and a sensitivity amplification controller is used for the swing leg. The controller is also designed to smoothly transition between these two schemes as the pilot walks. With hybrid control, the controller does not require a good model of the {BLEEX} torso and payload, which is difficult to obtain and subject to change as payload is added and removed. As a tradeoff, the position control used in this method requires the human to wear seven inclinometers to measure human limb and torso angles. These additional sensors require careful design to securely fasten them to the human and increase the time to don and doff {BLEEX.}},

We studied whether subjects without vestibular function would be able to substitute contact cues from the hand for their lost labyrinthine function and be able to balance as well as normal subjects in the dark without finger contact. We also studied the relative contribution of sight of the test chamber to the two groups. Subjects attempted to maintain a tandem Romberg stance for 25 s under three levels of fingertip contact: no contact; light-touch contact, up to 1 N (approximately 100 g) force; and unrestricted contact force. Both eyes open and eyes closed conditions were evaluated. Without contact, none of the vestibular loss subjects could stand for more than a few seconds in the dark without falling; all the normals could. The vestibular loss subjects were significantly more stable in the dark with light touch of the index finger than the normal subjects in the dark without touch. They also swayed less in the dark with light touch than when permitted sight of the test chamber without touch, and less with sight and touch than just sight. The normal subjects swayed less in the dark with touch than without, and less with sight and touch than sight alone. These findings show that during quiet stance light touch of the index finger with a stationary surface can be as effective or even more so than vestibular function for minimizing postural sway.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic perturbations of reaching movements are an important technique for studying motor learning and adaptation. Adaptation to non-contacting, velocity-dependent inertial Coriolis forces generated by arm movements during passive body rotation is very rapid, and when complete the Coriolis forces are no longer sensed. Adaptation to velocity-dependent forces delivered by a robotic manipulandum takes longer and the perturbations continue to be perceived even when adaptation is complete. These differences reflect adaptive self-calibration of motor control versus learning the behavior of an external object or 'tool'. Velocity-dependent inertial Coriolis forces also arise in everyday behavior during voluntary turn and reach movements but because of anticipatory feedforward motor compensations do not affect movement accuracy despite being larger than the velocity-dependent forces typically used in experimental studies. Progress has been made in understanding: the common features that determine adaptive responses to velocity-dependent perturbations of jaw and limb movements; the transfer of adaptation to mechanical perturbations across different contact sites on a limb; and the parcellation and separate representation of the static and dynamic components of multiforce perturbations.},

	Abstract = {Older adults show less lateralized task-related brain activity than young adults. One potential mechanism of this increased activation is that age-related degeneration of the corpus callosum {(CC)} may alter the balance of inhibition between the two hemispheres. To determine whether age differences in interhemispheric connectivity affect functional brain activity in older adults, we used magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} to assess resting functional connectivity and functional activation during a simple motor task. We found that older adults had smaller {CC} area compared to young adults. Older adults exhibited greater recruitment of ipsilateral primary motor cortex {(M1)}, which was associated with longer reaction times. Additionally, recruitment of ipsilateral M1 in older adults was correlated with reduced resting interhemispheric connectivity and a larger {CC.} We suggest that reduced interhemispheric connectivity reflects a loss of the ability to inhibit the non-dominant hemisphere during motor task performance for older adults, which has a negative impact on performance.},

	Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

This study aimed to establish the minimal detectable change {(MDC)} and clinically important differences {(CID)} of the Wolf Motor Function Test {(WMFT)} in patients with stroke, and to assess the proportions of patients' change scores exceeding the {MDC} and {CID} after stroke rehabilitation.


{METHODS}

A total of 57 patients received 1 of the 3 treatments for 3 weeks and underwent clinical assessments before and after treatment. The {MDC}, at 90\% confidence {(MDC(} 90)), was calculated from the standard error of measurement to indicate a real change for individual patients. Anchor-based and distribution-based approaches were used to triangulate the values of minimal {CID.} The percentages of patients exceeding the {MDC} and minimal {CID} were also examined.


{RESULTS}

The {MDC(90)} of the {WMFT} was 4.36 for the performance time {(WMFT} time) and 0.37 for the functional ability scale {(WMFT} {FAS).} The minimal {CID} ranged from 1.5 to 2 seconds on the {WMFT} time and from 0.2 to 0.4 points on the {WMFT} {FAS.} The {MDC} and {CID} proportions ranged from 14\% to 30\% on the {WMFT} time and from 39\% to 65\% on the {WMFT} {FAS}, respectively.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The change score of an individual patient has to reach 4.36 and 0.37 on the {WMFT} time and {WMFT} {FAS} to indicate a real change. The mean change scores of a stroke group on the {WMFT} time and {WMFT} {FAS} should achieve 1.5 to 2 seconds and 0.2 to 0.4 points to be regarded as clinically important changes. Furthermore, the {WMFT} {FAS} may be more responsive than the {WMFT} time based on the results of proportions exceeding the threshold criteria.},

	Abstract = {Using the ankle musculature, subjects balanced a large inverted pendulum. The equilibrium of the pendulum is unstable and quasi-regular sway was observed like that in quiet standing. Two main questions were addressed. Can subjects systematically change sway size in response to instruction and availability of visual feedback? If so, do subjects decrease sway size by increasing ankle impedance or by some alternative mechanism? The position of the pendulum, the torque generated at each ankle and the soleus and tibialis anterior {EMG} were recorded. Results showed that subjects could significantly reduce the mean sway size of the pendulum by giving full attention to that goal. With visual feedback sway size could be minimised significantly more than without visual feedback. In changing sway size, the frequency of the sways was not changed. Results also revealed that ankle impedance and muscle co-contraction were not significantly changed when the sway size was decreased. As the ankle impedance and sway frequency do not change when the sway size is decreased, this implies no change in ankle stiffness or viscosity. Increasing ankle impedance, stiffness or viscosity are not the only methods by which sway size could be reduced. A reduction in torque noise or torque inaccuracy via a predictive process which provides active damping could reduce sway size without changing ankle impedance and is plausible given the data. Such a strategy involving motion recognition and generation of an accurate motor response may require higher levels of control than changing ankle impedance by altering reflex or feedforward gain.},

	Abstract = {In standing, there are small sways of the body. Our interest is to use an artificial task to illuminate the mechanisms underlying the sways and to account for changes in their size. Using the ankle musculature, subjects balanced a large inverted pendulum. The equilibrium of the pendulum is unstable and quasi-regular sway was observed like that in quiet standing. By giving full attention to minimising sway subjects could systematically reduce pendulum movement. The pendulum position, the torque generated at each ankle and the soleus and tibialis anterior {EMGs} were recorded. Explanations about how the human inverted pendulum is balanced usually ignore the fact that balance is maintained over a range of angles and not just at one angle. Any resting equilibrium position of the pendulum is unstable and in practice temporary; movement to a different resting equilibrium position can only be accomplished by a biphasic `throw and catch' pattern of torque and not by an elastic mechanism. Results showed that balance was achieved by the constant repetition of a neurally generated ballistic-like biphasic pattern of torque which can control both position and sway size. A decomposition technique revealed that there was a substantial contribution to changes in torque from intrinsic mechanical ankle stiffness; however, by itself this was insufficient to maintain balance or to control position. Minimisation of sway size was caused by improvement in the accuracy of the anticipatory torque impulses. We hypothesise that examination of centre of mass and centre of pressure data for quiet standing will duplicate these results.},

	Abstract = {During quiet standing the human `inverted pendulum' sways irregularly. In previous work where subjects balanced a real inverted pendulum, we investigated what contribution the intrinsic mechanical ankle stiffness makes to achieve stability. Using the results of a plausible model, we suggested that intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate for providing stability. Here, using a piezo-electric translator we applied small, unobtrusive mechanical perturbations to the foot while the subject was standing freely. These short duration perturbations had a similar size and velocity to movements which occur naturally during quiet standing, and they produced no evidence of any stretch reflex response in soleus, or gastrocnemius. Direct measurement confirms our earlier conclusion; intrinsic ankle stiffness is not quite sufficient to stabilise the body or pendulum. On average the directly determined intrinsic stiffness is 91 $\pm$ 23 \% (mean $\pm$ s.d.) of that necessary to provide minimal stabilisation. The stiffness was substantially constant, increasing only slightly with ankle torque. This stiffness cannot be neurally regulated in quiet standing. Thus we attribute this stiffness to the foot, Achilles' tendon and aponeurosis rather than the activated calf muscle fibres. Our measurements suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance via a spring-like element which is itself too compliant to guarantee stability. The implication is that the brain cannot set ankle stiffness and then ignore the control task because additional modulation of torque is required to maintain balance. We suggest that the triceps surae muscles maintain balance by predictively controlling the proximal offset of the spring-like element in a ballistic-like manner.},

@article{malone_thinking_2010,
	Abstract = {Control of the human walking pattern normally requires little thought, with conscious control used only in the face of a challenging environment or a perturbation. We have previously shown that people can adapt spatial and temporal aspects of walking to a sustained perturbation generated by a split-belt treadmill. Here we tested whether conscious correction of walking, versus distraction from it, modifies adaptation. Conscious correction of stepping may expedite the adaptive process and help to form a new walking pattern. However, because walking is normally an automatic process, it is possible that conscious effort could interfere with adaptation, whereas distraction might improve it by removing competing voluntary control. Three groups of subjects were studied: a control group was given no specific instructions, a conscious correction group was instructed how to step and given intermittent visual feedback of stepping during adaptation, and a distraction group performed a dual-task during adaptation. After adaptation, retention of aftereffects was assessed in all groups during normal treadmill walking without conscious effort, feedback, or distraction. We found that conscious correction speeds adaptation, whereas distraction slows it. Subjects trained with distraction retained aftereffects longest, suggesting that the training used during adaptation predicts the time course of deadaptation. An unexpected finding was that these manipulations affected the adaptation rate of spatial but not temporal elements of walking. Thus conscious processes can preferentially access the spatial walking pattern. It may be that spatial and temporal controls of locomotion are accessible through distinct neural circuits, with the former being most sensitive to conscious effort or distraction.},

@article{maluf_task_2005,
	Abstract = {By comparing the physiological adjustments that occur when two similar fatiguing contractions are performed to failure, it is possible to identify mechanisms that limit the duration of the more difficult task. This approach has been used to study two fatiguing contractions, referred to as the force and position tasks, which differed in the type of feedback given to the subject and the amount of support provided by the surroundings. Even though the two tasks required a similar net muscle torque during submaximal isometric contractions, the duration that the position task could be sustained was consistently much briefer than that for the force task. The position task involved a greater rate of increase in {EMG} activity and more marked changes in motor unit recruitment and rate coding compared with the force task. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the motor unit pool was recruited more rapidly during the position task. The difference in motor unit behavior appeared to be caused by variation in synaptic input, likely involving heightened sensitivity of the stretch reflex during the position task. Upon repeat performances of the two fatiguing contractions, some subjects were able to increase the time to failure for the force task but not the position task. Furthermore, the time to failure for the position task could be influenced by the postural demands associated with maintaining the position of the limb, and the difference in the two durations was enhanced when the postural activity evoked a pressor response. These observations indicate that the difference in the duration of the two fatiguing contractions was attributable to differences in the control strategy used to sustain the tasks and the magnitude of the associated postural activity.},

	Abstract = {Existing prosthetic limbs do not provide amputees with cutaneous feedback. Tactile feedback is essential to intuitive control of a prosthetic limb and it is now clear that the sense of body self-identification is also linked to cutaneous touch. Here we have created an artificial sense of touch for a prosthetic limb by coupling a pressure sensor on the hand through a robotic stimulator to surgically redirected cutaneous sensory nerves (targeted reinnervation) that once served the lost limb. We hypothesize that providing physiologically relevant cutaneous touch feedback may help an amputee incorporate an artificial limb into his or her self image. To investigate this we used a robotic touch interface coupled with a prosthetic limb and tested it with two targeted reinnervation amputees in a series of experiments fashioned after the Rubber Hand Illusion. Results from both subjective (self-reported) and objective (physiological) measures of embodiment (questionnaires, psychophysical temporal order judgements and residual limb temperature measurements) indicate that returning physiologically appropriate cutaneous feedback from a prosthetic limb drives a perceptual shift towards embodiment of the device for these amputees. Measurements provide evidence that the illusion created is vivid. We suggest that this may help amputees to more effectively incorporate an artificial limb into their self image, providing the possibility that a prosthesis becomes not only a tool, but also an integrated body part.},

Research has also focused on how this may lead to multisensorially determined perceptions of body parts, to action execution, and even to attributions of agency and self-ownership for the body parts in question. Converging evidence from animal and human studies suggests that the primate brain constructs various body-part-centred representations of space, based on the integration of visual, tactile and proprioceptive information. These representations can plastically change following active tool-use that extends reachable space and also modifies the representation of peripersonal space.

This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and {EMG-} based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

Analyses using default-mode network nodes as seed regions revealed connectivity patterns similar to previous studies of the default network and therefore provide evidence that this network is demonstrable using a synchronized motor activation paradigm. We did not find evidence suggesting that motor deactivation represents modulation of the default mode network. Therefore, motor deactivation is likely a motor-specific process.

@article{mayer_body_2008,
	Abstract = {{AIM}

The phantom phenomenon is a well-known example of the difference between body awareness and body schema. The present study is aimed at showing how body changes and prosthesis use are reflected in body schema and body awareness-the latter relating to the image that various amputees have of their bodies.


{SUBJECT} {AND} {METHODS}

(i) Examining the configuration of body schema: A trial examining the spatial location of the phantom limb (50 people with lower or upper limb loss); (ii) examining the functional aspect of body schema: The distribution of weight power between intact and prosthetic limbs (34 people with tibial amputation); (iii) examining body awareness: Body Focus Questionnaire by Fisher (44 people with lower limb amputation, 33 intact people); and (iv) Questionnaire on anamnesis- and prosthesis-wearing habits (people participating in research methods [i] and [iii] mentioned above).


{RESULTS}

We found that when the amputees wore their prostheses, the configuration of body schema did not change, however, the people who had not used their prosthesis for a long period of time (in our study, at least for six years), the phantom limb shortened, a phenomenon known as telescoping. The functional adaptation of the prosthesis to the body schema starts in a short time (within two weeks) after wearing it, and it becomes close to normal in carrying body weight after a longer period of time (two years). In the beginning phase of rehabilitation, the awareness of legs is similar to that of the control group, while later on it this awareness decreases. Over time, however, the lost limb, regardless of having a prosthesis or not, loses its importance. People with a more serious or vascular amputation of the upper limbs have a clearer image of them. Limb parts having a greater cortical representation appear more intensively in phantom sensations, while the strength of the cortical representation in body schema has no significance.


{CONCLUSION}

From both configuration and functional aspects, wearing a prosthesis helps maintain a body schema in which the phantom limb remains similar to the intact one, which can be explained by the connectional schema model. This is needed for movements to be carried out properly. Although the amputee can see the prosthesis and senses the phantom limb, they do not consider it their own since they are aware of the loss. Therefore, the fact that a prosthesis is worn will not be represented in body awareness as the highest level of mental structure.},

@article{mehrholz_electromechanical-assisted_2007,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Electromechanical and robotic-assisted gait training devices are used in rehabilitation and might help to improve walking after stroke.


{OBJECTIVES}

To investigate the effect of automated electromechanical and robotic-assisted gait training devices for improving walking after stroke.


{SEARCH} {STRATEGY}

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials {(CENTRAL)} {(The} Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006), {MEDLINE} (1966 to September 2006), {EMBASE} (1980 to September 2006), {CINAHL} (1982 to October 2006), {AMED} (1985 to October 2006), {SPORTDiscus} (1949 to August 2006), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database {(PEDro}, searched September 2006) and the engineering databases {COMPENDEX} (1972 to October 2006) and {INSPEC} (1969 to October 2006). We handsearched relevant conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, checked reference lists and contacted authors in an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials.


{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}

We included studies using random assignment.


{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients walking independently (without assistance or help of a person) at follow up.


{MAIN} {RESULTS}

Eight trials (414 participants) were included in this review. Electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with physiotherapy increased the odds of becoming independent in walking (odds ratio {(OR)} 3.06, 95\% confidence interval {(CI)} 1.85 to 5.06; P {\textless} 0.001), and increased walking capacity (mean difference {(MD)} = 34 metres walked in six minutes, 95\% {CI} 8 to 60; P = 0.010), but did not increase walking velocity significantly {(MD} = 0.08 m/sec, 95\% {CI} -0.01 to 0.17; P = 0.08). However, the results must be interpreted with caution because (1) variations between the trials were found with respect to duration and frequency of treatment and differences in ambulatory status of patients, and (2) some trials tested electromechanical devices in combination with functional electrical stimulation.


{AUTHORS'} {CONCLUSIONS}

Patients who receive electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with physiotherapy after stroke are more likely to achieve independent walking than patients receiving gait training without these devices. However, further research should address specific questions, for example, which frequency or duration of electromechanical-assisted gait training might be most effective and at what time after stroke, and follow-up studies are needed to find out how long the benefit lasts. Future research should include estimates of the costs (or savings) due to electromechanical gait training.},

	Abstract = {Robotic systems that are interfaced with virtual reality gaming and task simulations are increasingly being developed to provide repetitive intensive practice to promote increased compliance and facilitate better outcomes in rehabilitation post-stroke. A major development in the use of virtual environments {(VEs)} has been to incorporate tactile information and interaction forces into what was previously an essentially visual experience. Robots of varying complexity are being interfaced with more traditional virtual presentations to provide haptic feedback that enriches the sensory experience and adds physical task parameters. This provides forces that produce biomechanical and neuromuscular interactions with the {VE} that approximate real-world movement more accurately than visual-only {VEs}, simulating the weight and force found in upper extremity tasks. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of several systems that are commercially available for ambulation training and for training movement of the upper extremity. We will also report on the system that we have developed {(NJIT-RAVR} system) that incorporates motivating and challenging haptic feedback effects into {VE} simulations to facilitate motor recovery of the upper extremity post-stroke. The {NJIT-RAVR} system trains both the upper arm and the hand. The robotic arm acts as an interface between the participants and the {VEs}, enabling multiplanar movements against gravity in a three-dimensional workspace. The ultimate question is whether this medium can provide a motivating, challenging, gaming experience with dramatically decreased physical difficulty levels, which would allow for participation by an obese person and facilitate greater adherence to exercise regimes.},

	Abstract = {Modern hand and wrist prostheses afford a high level of mechanical sophistication, but the ability to control them in an intuitive and repeatable manner lags. Commercially available systems using surface electromyographic {(EMG)} or myoelectric control can supply at best two degrees of freedom {(DOF)}, most often sequentially controlled. This limitation is partially due to the nature of surface-recorded {EMG}, for which the signal contains components from multiple muscle sources. We report here on the development of an implantable myoelectric sensor using {EMG} sensors that can be chronically implanted into an amputee's residual muscles. Because sensing occurs at the source of muscle contraction, a single principal component of {EMG} is detected by each sensor, corresponding to intent to move a particular effector. This system can potentially provide independent signal sources for control of individual effectors within a limb prosthesis. The use of implanted devices supports inter-day signal repeatability. We report on efforts in preparation for human clinical trials, including animal testing, and a first-in-human proof of principle demonstration where the subject was able to intuitively and simultaneously control two {DOF} in a hand and wrist prosthesis.},

@article{liepert_motor_1998,
	Abstract = {Stroke patients in the chronic phase received constraint-induced {(CI)} movement therapy. The motor cortex was spatially mapped using focal transcranial magnetic stimulation {(TMS)} before and after 2 weeks of treatment. Motor-output areas of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, motor evoked potential {(MEP)} amplitudes and location of centre of gravity {(CoG)} of motor cortex output were studied. After {CI} therapy, motor performance improved substantially in all patients. There was also an increase of motor output area size and {MEP} amplitudes, indicating enhanced neuronal excitability in the damaged hemisphere for the target muscles. The mean centre of gravity of the motor output maps was shifted considerably after the rehabilitation, indicating the recruitment of motor areas adjacent to the original location. Thus, even in chronic stroke patients, reduced motor cortex representations of an affected body part can be enlarged and increased in level of excitability by an effective rehabilitation procedure. The data therefore demonstrate a {CNS} correlate of therapy-induced recovery of function after nervous system damage in humans.},

These concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. In particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar Purkinje cells. Multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. The `minimum variance model' is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. This model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.},

Spinal cord circuits are capable of significant reorganization, in the form of both activity-dependent and injury-induced plasticity. This plasticity is manifest behaviourally in the ability of spinal animals to learn new locomotor tasks. Recent work with spinal-injured humans demonstrates that training can improve functional locomotor abilities. New methodologies to enhance limb movement are designed to exploit further the plastic capabilities of the spinal cord by reinforcing appropriate connections in an activity-dependent manner. In the future, these methods might also prove useful in guiding and strengthening functional synaptogenesis of regenerating axons to maximize their contribution towards restoration of function.},

To gain an understanding of the embodied perceptual experience of successful prosthesis.


{METHOD}

The data for this study were transcripts derived from in-depth semi-structured e-mail (n=21) and face-to-face (n=14) interviews, and the documentary analysis of an e-mail discussion group for prosthesis users. This qualitative data was subject to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Analysis of the research data identified six themes in the perceptually embodied experiences of prosthesis users: Adjusting to a prosthetic; The Balance of the Body; Awareness of the Prosthesis; The Knowing Body; The Phantom Becomes the Prosthesis: Extending the Body; and The Prosthesis as Tool or Corporeal Structure.


{CONCLUSION}

The often-cited reasons for the rejection of prostheses are frequently part of the initial experiences of 'successful' prosthesis users also. This suggests the need to sufficiently motivate potential prosthesis users in the period between an experience of prosthesis use as unnatural and wieldy to one of pre-reflective, natural use. In addition, two broad forms of prosthesis experience were identified: one in which the prosthesis was experienced as a corporeal structure; and one in which it was viewed as a tool. While future work may be able to explore the psychosocial correlates of these experiences, it is nonetheless the case that persons with these differing experiences were able to enjoy the benefits imbued by prosthesis use.},

These studies have also pointed out that adaptation to novel dynamics is aimed at preserving the trajectories of a controlled endpoint, either the hand of a subject or a transported object. We review some of these experiments and present more recent studies aimed at understanding how the motor system forms representations of the physical space in which actions take place. An extensive line of investigations in visual information processing has dealt with the issue of how the Euclidean properties of space are recovered from visual signals that do not appear to possess these properties. The same question is addressed here in the context of motor behavior and motor learning by observing how people remap hand gestures and body motions that control the state of an external device. We present some theoretical considerations and experimental evidence about the ability of the nervous system to create novel patterns of coordination that are consistent with the representation of extrapersonal space. We also discuss the perspective of endowing human-machine interfaces with learning algorithms that, combined with human learning, may facilitate the control of powered wheelchairs and other assistive devices.},

Rules are then proposed to describe the central organization of posture controls within the sensory and mechanical constraints. The organizational rules and knowledge of constraints are combined to predict the effects of selective semicircular canal and utricular otolith lesions on postural stability and the patterns of body and head movements used to maintain balance. Our analysis leads to the prediction that semicircular canal and otolith deficits destabilize patients at different frequencies, and force them to use different patterns of body and head movements. These predictions are compared to posture controls observed in patients with different types of vestibular deficits. The additional steps required to prove or disprove the theory are discussed.},

@article{nielsen_sensorimotor_2004,
	Abstract = {Spinal reflexes have traditionally been treated as separate from voluntary movements. However, animal experiments since the 1950s and human experiments since the 1970s have documented that sensory activities in afferents from muscles, skin, and joints are integrated with descending motor commands at the level of common spinal interneurons. Two different roles of this sensorimotor integration at the spinal level may be discerned. First, sensory feedback evoked by the active muscles may help to drive the motoneurons. Second, external stimuli, such as sudden perturbations of a limb, may give rise to "error signals," which are integrated into the ongoing motor activity and form the basis of corrective responses. When interpreting experimental data, it is important to consider these two different roles. Application of external stimuli may provide little information about how the spinal cord integrates sensory feedback evoked as part of ongoing movements. The complexity of the spinal machinery that is activated by external stimuli also makes the interpretation of data obtained from experiments dealing with artificial external stimuli, such as electrical stimuli, difficult. Nevertheless, such experiments have provided and will continue to provide very valuable information about how the brain and spinal cord ensure coordination of muscle activity during voluntary movement. So far, spinal control mechanisms have only been investigated to a limited extent in relation to sports and occupational activities. Provided that researchers consider the methodological problems of the techniques and that they seek independent validation of the findings, this may be a very fruitful research field in the future.},

@article{noel_electrohydraulic_2008,
	Abstract = {The control of human walking can be temporarily modified by applying forces to the leg. To study the neural mechanisms underlying this adaptive capacity, a device delivering controlled forces and high-velocity displacements to the ankle was designed. A new solution, involving a closed circuit hydraulic system composed of two cylinders (master-slave) mutually connected by hoses and controlled by an electric motor was preferred over classical mechanical/electrical approaches. The slave cylinder delivers desired torques to the ankle using a light weight, custom-designed ankle-foot orthosis. This electrohydraulic orthosis {(EHO)} can produce several types of force fields during walking, including constant, position-dependent, and phase-dependent. With phase-dependent force fields, active torque cancellation maintains low-residual torques (les1.85 Nm root mean square) outside of the zone of force application for walking speeds ranging from 0.2 to 4.5 km/h. Rapid ankle stretches/unloads ({\textgreater}200deg/s) can also be produced alone or during force field application, and elicited proprioceptive reflexes in ankle muscles. In conclusion, the {EHO} is capable of delivering controlled force fields and of activating proprioceptive reflexes during human walking. It will provide the flexibility needed to test the adaptability of healthy and pathological gait control, and to address some of its underlying neural mechanisms.},

@article{noel_using_2009,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Adapting to external forces during walking has been proposed as a tool to improve locomotion after central nervous system injury. However, sensorimotor integration during walking varies according to the timing in the gait cycle, suggesting that adaptation may also depend on gait phases. In this study, an {ElectroHydraulic} {AFO} {(EHO)} was used to apply forces specifically during mid-stance and push-off to evaluate if feedforward movement control can be adapted in these 2 gait phases.


{METHODS}

Eleven healthy subjects walked on a treadmill before (3 min), during (5 min) and after (5 min) exposure to 2 force fields applied by the {EHO} (mid-stance/push-off; approximately 10 Nm, towards dorsiflexion). To evaluate modifications in feedforward control, strides with no force field ('catch strides') were unexpectedly inserted during the force field walking period.


{RESULTS}

When initially exposed to a mid-stance force field {(FF} 20\%), subjects showed a significant increase in ankle dorsiflexion velocity. Catches applied early into the {FF} 20\% were similar to baseline {(P} {\textgreater} 0.99). Subjects gradually adapted by returning ankle velocity to baseline over approximately 50 strides. Catches applied thereafter showed decreased ankle velocity where the force field was normally applied, indicating the presence of feedforward adaptation. When initially exposed to a push-off force field {(FF} 50\%), plantarflexion velocity was reduced in the zone of force field application. No adaptation occurred over the 5 min exposure. Catch strides kinematics remained similar to control at all times, suggesting no feedforward adaptation. As a control, force fields assisting plantarflexion (-3.5 to -9.5 Nm) were applied and increased ankle plantarflexion during push-off, confirming that the lack of kinematic changes during {FF} 50\% catch strides were not simply due to a large ankle impedance.


{CONCLUSION}

Together these results show that ankle exoskeletons such as the {EHO} can be used to study phase-specific adaptive control of the ankle during locomotion. Our data suggest that, for short duration exposure, a feedforward modification in torque output occurs during mid-stance but not during push-off. These findings are important for the design of novel rehabilitation methods, as they suggest that the ability to use resistive force fields for training may depend on targeted gait phases.},

Intracortical microstimulation {(ICMS)} techniques were used to derive detailed maps of distal forelimb movement representations in primary motor cortex (area 4) of adult squirrel monkeys before and a few months after a focal ischemic infarct. 2. Infarcts caused a marked but transient deficit in use of the contralateral hand, as evidenced by increased use of the ipsilateral hand, and reduced performance on a task requiring skilled digit use. 3. Infarcts resulted in a widespread reduction in the areal extent of digit representations adjacent to the lesion, and apparent increases in adjacent proximal representations. 4. We conclude that substantial functional reorganization occurs in primary motor cortex of adult primates following a focal ischemic infarct, but at least in the absence of postinfarct training, the movements formerly represented in the infarcted zone do not reappear in adjacent cortical regions.},

We found that this multisensory procedure had an effect on participants' body perception as well as social perception. Study participants exposed to synchronous stimulation showed more merging of self and the other than participants exposed to asynchronous stimulation. The degree of self-other merging was determined by measuring participants' body sensations and their perception of face resemblance, as well as participants' judgment of the inner state of the other, closeness felt toward the other, and conformity behavior. The results of this study show how multisensory integration can affect social perception and create a sense of self-other similarity.},

In a comparative {fMRI} study, we scanned a large cohort of human volunteers and untrained monkeys, as well as two monkeys trained to use tools, while they observed hand actions and actions performed using simple tools. In both species, the observation of an action, regardless of how performed, activated occipitotemporal, intraparietal, and ventral premotor cortex, bilaterally. In humans, the observation of actions done with simple tools yielded an additional, specific activation of a rostral sector of the left inferior parietal lobule {(IPL).} This latter site was considered human-specific, as it was not observed in monkey {IPL} for any of the tool videos presented, even after monkeys had become proficient in using a rake or pliers through extensive training. In conclusion, while the observation of a grasping hand activated similar regions in humans and monkeys, an additional specific sector of {IPL} devoted to tool use has evolved in Homo sapiens, although tool-specific neurons might reside in the monkey grasping regions. These results shed new light on the changes of the hominid brain during evolution.},

@article{peterka_sensorimotor_2002,
	Abstract = {It is generally accepted that human bipedal upright stance is achieved by feedback mechanisms that generate an appropriate corrective torque based on body-sway motion detected primarily by visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive sensory systems. Because orientation information from the various senses is not always available (eyes closed) or accurate (compliant support surface), the postural control system must somehow adjust to maintain stance in a wide variety of environmental conditions. This is the sensorimotor integration problem that we investigated by evoking anterior-posterior {(AP)} body sway using pseudorandom rotation of the visual surround and/or support surface (amplitudes 0.5--8$\,^{\circ}$) in both normal subjects and subjects with severe bilateral vestibular loss {(VL).} {AP} rotation of body center-of-mass {(COM)} was measured in response to six conditions offering different combinations of available sensory information. Stimulus-response data were analyzed using spectral analysis to compute transfer functions and coherence functions over a frequency range from 0.017 to 2.23 Hz. Stimulus-response data were quite linear for any given condition and amplitude. However, overall behavior in normal subjects was nonlinear because gain decreased and phase functions sometimes changed with increasing stimulus amplitude. {``Sensory} channel reweighting'' could account for this nonlinear behavior with subjects showing increasing reliance on vestibular cues as stimulus amplitudes increased. {VL} subjects could not perform this reweighting, and their stimulus-response behavior remained quite linear. Transfer function curve fits based on a simple feedback control model provided estimates of postural stiffness, damping, and feedback time delay. There were only small changes in these parameters with increasing visual stimulus amplitude. However, stiffness increased as much as 60\% with increasing support surface amplitude. To maintain postural stability and avoid resonant behavior, an increase in stiffness should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in damping. Increased damping was achieved primarily by decreasing the apparent time delay of feedback control rather than by changing the damping coefficient (i.e., corrective torque related to body-sway velocity). In normal subjects, stiffness and damping were highly correlated with body mass and moment of inertia, with stiffness always about 1/3 larger than necessary to resist the destabilizing torque due to gravity. The stiffness parameter in some {VL} subjects was larger compared with normal subjects, suggesting that they may use increased stiffness to help compensate for their loss. Overall results show that the simple act of standing quietly depends on a remarkably complex sensorimotor control system.},

	Abstract = {The experiments identify some of the processes underlying arm movements in rhesus monkeys. Three monkeys were trained to point to a target with the hand and forearm and to hold that position for about 1 second to obtain a reward. Forearm movements were performed without sight of the arm before and after bilateral dorsal rhizotomy. In both intact and deafferented animals, we unexpectedly displaced the forearm prior to movement initiation and observed that the arm moved accurately to the target. These results are relevant to the question of what is being controlled by motor commands. The controlled variable appears to be an equilibrium point between agonist and antagonist muscles. The findings suggest that the feedback system plays a major role in updating and adjusting the central programs subserving the execution of learned motor patterns.},

In order to be transparent, the exoskeleton must determine the user's intent, apply forces when and where appropriate, and present low impedance to the wearer. We present a one degree of freedom exoskeleton called the {RoboKnee} which achieves a high level of transparency. User intent is determined through the knee joint angle and ground reaction forces. Torque is applied across the knee in order to allow the user's quadriceps muscles to relax. Low impedance is achieved through the use of series elastic actuators. The {RoboKnee} allows the wearer to climb stairs and perform deep knee bends while carrying a significant load in a backpack. The device provides most of the energy required to work against gravity while the user stays in control, deciding when and where to walk, as well as providing balance and control.

	Abstract = {Objective: This report describes the operation of the Bionic Glove, a new functional electrical stimulation {(FES)} device designed to improve the function of the paralyzed hand after spinal cord injury {(SCI)} or stroke.

Design: Signals from a sensor in the glove detecting voluntary wrist movement are used to control {FES} of muscles either to produce hand-grasp or to open the hand. When the glove is donned, conductive areas on its inside surface automatically make contact with self-adhesive electrodes on the skin.

Setting and Patients: This report concerns nine people with {SCI} who have used the device in their daily lives for up to a year or more. Measurements were made at clinics in Edmonton, Miami, and Chicago as part of a multicenter clinical trial.

Outcome Measures and Results: The mean peak force of tenodesis grasp in the nine subjects increased from {2.6N} (passive) to {11.3N} (glove active). Active force was significantly greater than passive grasp force even when muscles were fatigued after repetitive grasp-release cycles. Most manual tasks improved significantly with the use of the glove, as judged by the number of tasks completed in a minute or the subjects' qualitative ratings of task difficulty.

Conclusion: The Bionic Glove can provide significant improvement of hand function in people with {C6-C7} {SCI.}},

	Abstract = {Background
Long-term potentiation {(LTP)} and long-term depression {(LTD)} play important roles in mediating activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission and are believed to be crucial mechanisms underlying learning and cortical plasticity. In human subjects, however, the lack of adequate input stimuli for the induction of {LTP} and {LTD} makes it difficult to study directly the impact of such protocols on behavior.

Results
Using tactile high- and low-frequency stimulation protocols in humans, we explored the potential of such protocols for the induction of perceptual changes. We delivered tactile high-frequency and low-frequency stimuli {(t-HFS}, {t-LFS)} to skin sites of approximately 50 mm2 on the tip of the index finger. As assessed by 2-point discrimination, we demonstrate that 20 minutes of {t-HFS} improved tactile discrimination, while {t-LFS} impaired performance. {T-HFS-effects} were stable for at least 24 hours whereas {t-LFS-induced} changes recovered faster. While {t-HFS} changes were spatially very specific with no changes on the neighboring fingers, impaired tactile performance after {t-LFS} was also observed on the right middle-finger. A central finding was that for both {t-LFS} and {t-HFS} perceptual changes were dependent on the size of the stimulated skin area. No changes were observed when the stimulated area was very small ({\textless} 1 mm2) indicating special requirements for spatial summation.

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate differential effects of such protocols in a frequency specific manner that might be related to {LTP-} and {LTD-like} changes in human subjects.},

For therapeutic applications of robotic orthoses, slacking may reduce human effort during rehabilitation training, with negative consequences for use-dependent motor recovery.

By using robots to apply novel force fields to the arm, investigators are gaining insight into how the nervous system models its external dynamic environment. The nervous system builds internal models gradually by experience and uses them in combination with impedance and feedback control strategies. Internal models are robust to environmental and neural noise, generalized across space, implemented in multiple brain regions, and developed in childhood. Robots are also being used to assist in repetitive movement practice following neurologic injury, providing insight into movement recovery. Robots can haptically assess sensorimotor performance, administer training, quantify amount of training, and improve motor recovery. In addition to providing insight into motor control, robotic paradigms may eventually enhance motor learning and rehabilitation beyond the levels possible with conventional training techniques.},

	Abstract = {Motor skills can take weeks to months to acquire and can diminish over time in the absence of continued practice. Thus, strategies that enhance skill acquisition or retention are of great scientific and practical interest. Here we investigated the effect of noninvasive cortical stimulation on the extended time course of learning a novel and challenging motor skill task. A skill measure was chosen to reflect shifts in the task's speed--accuracy tradeoff function {(SAF)}, which prevented us from falsely interpreting variations in position along an unchanged {SAF} as a change in skill. Subjects practiced over 5 consecutive days while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation {(tDCS)} over the primary motor cortex {(M1).} Using the skill measure, we assessed the impact of anodal (relative to sham) {tDCS} on both within-day (online) and between-day (offline) effects and on the rate of forgetting during a 3-month follow-up (long-term retention). There was greater total (online plus offline) skill acquisition with anodal {tDCS} compared to sham, which was mediated through a selective enhancement of offline effects. Anodal {tDCS} did not change the rate of forgetting relative to sham across the 3-month follow-up period, and consequently the skill measure remained greater with anodal {tDCS} at 3 months. This prolonged enhancement may hold promise for the rehabilitation of brain injury. Furthermore, these findings support the existence of a consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal {tDCS}, which contributes to offline effects but not to online effects or long-term retention.},

Results from previous experiments using the pattern generator/pattern shaper {(PG/PS)} controller to generate isometric contractions demonstrated its ability to adjust stimulation patterns to account for recruitment nonlinearities and muscle dynamics. In this study, the {PG/PS} controller was tested under isotonic conditions. This evaluation required the {PG/PS} controller to account for muscle length-tension and force-velocity properties as well as limb dynamics. The performance of the adaptive controller was also compared with that of a proportional-derivative {(PD)} feedback controller. The {PG/PS} controller is composed of a neural network system that adaptively filters a periodic signal to produce a muscle stimulation pattern for generating cyclic movements. We used computer-simulated models to determine controller parameters for the {PG/PS} and {PD} controller that perform well across a variety of musculoskeletal systems. The controllers were then experimentally evaluated on both legs of two subjects with spinal cord injury. Results indicated that the {PG/PS} controller was able to achieve and maintain better tracking performance than the {PD} controller. This study indicates that the {PG/PS} control system may provide an effective mechanism for automatically customizing stimulation patterns for individuals using {FNS} systems},

@article{safavynia_muscle_2011,
	Abstract = {We present a method called muscle synergy analysis , which can offer clinicians insight into both underlying neural strategies for movement and functional outcomes of muscle activity. Although neural dysfunction is central to many motor deficits, neural activity during movements is not directly measurable. Consequently, the majority of clinical tests focus on evaluating motor outputs at the behavioral and kinematic levels. However, altered behavioral or kinematic outcomes could be the result of multiple distinct neural abnormalities with very different muscle coordination patterns. Because muscle activity reflects motoneuron activity and generates the forces that produce behavioral outcomes, an analysis of muscle activity may provide a better understanding of the functional neural deficits in the impaired nervous system. Unfortunately, electromyographic datasets can be large, highly variable, and difficult to interpret, precluding their clinical utility. Computational analyses can be used to extract muscle synergies from such datasets, revealing underlying patterns that may reflect different levels of neural function. These muscle synergies are hypothesized to represent motor modules recruited by the nervous system to flexibly perform biomechanical subtasks necessary for movement. For example, hemiparetic stroke patients exhibit differences in the number of muscle synergies, which may reflect disruptions in descending neural pathways and are correlated to deficits in motor function. Muscle synergy analysis may thus offer the clinician a better view of the neural structure underlying motor behaviors and how they change in motor deficits and rehabilitation. Such information could inform diagnostic tools and evidence-based interventions specifically targeted to a patient's deficits.},

	Abstract = {Robotic lower limb exoskeletons that can alter joint mechanical power output are novel tools for studying the relationship between the mechanics and energetics of human locomotion. We built pneumatically powered ankle exoskeletons controlled by the user's own soleus electromyography (i.e. proportional myoelectric control) to determine whether mechanical assistance at the ankle joint could reduce the metabolic cost of level, steady-speed human walking. We hypothesized that subjects would reduce their net metabolic power in proportion to the average positive mechanical power delivered by the bilateral ankle exoskeletons. Nine healthy individuals completed three 30 min sessions walking at 1.25 m s--1 while wearing the exoskeletons. Over the three sessions, subjects' net metabolic energy expenditure during powered walking progressed from +7\% to --10\% of that during unpowered walking. With practice, subjects significantly reduced soleus muscle activity (by ∼28\% root mean square {EMG}, P{\textless}0.0001) and negative exoskeleton mechanical power (--0.09 W kg--1 at the beginning of session 1 and --0.03 W kg--1 at the end of session 3; P=0.005). Ankle joint kinematics returned to similar patterns to those observed during unpowered walking. At the end of the third session, the powered exoskeletons delivered ∼63\% of the average ankle joint positive mechanical power and ∼22\% of the total positive mechanical power generated by all of the joints summed (ankle, knee and hip) during unpowered walking. Decreases in total joint positive mechanical power due to powered ankle assistance (∼22\%) were not proportional to reductions in net metabolic power (∼10\%). The `apparent efficiency' of the ankle joint muscle--tendon system during human walking (∼0.61) was much greater than reported values of the `muscular efficiency' of positive mechanical work for human muscle (∼0.10--0.34). High ankle joint `apparent efficiency' suggests that recoiling Achilles' tendon contributes a significant amount of ankle joint positive power during the push-off phase of walking in humans.},

Our general hypothesis is that these same attributes make robotic technologies ideal for clinically assessing sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments in stroke and other neurological disorders. Further, they provide opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. The present opinionated review describes how robotic technologies combined with virtual/augmented reality systems can support a broad range of behavioral tasks to objectively quantify brain function. This information could potentially be used to provide more accurate diagnostic and prognostic information than is available from current clinical assessment techniques. The review also highlights the potential benefits of robots to provide upper-limb therapy. Although the capital cost of these technologies is substantial, it pales in comparison with the potential cost reductions to the overall healthcare system that improved assessment and therapeutic interventions offer.},

@article{seidler_neuroanatomical_2008,
	Abstract = {The acquisition of new motor skills is dependent on task practice. In the case of motor transfer, learning can be facilitated by prior practice of a similar skill. Although a multitude of studies have investigated the brain regions contributing to skill acquisition, the neural bases associated with the savings seen at transfer have yet to be determined. In the current study, we used functional {MRI} to examine how brain activation differs during acquisition and transfer of a visuomotor adaptation task. Two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to three different rotations of the feedback display in a sequential fashion, with a return to baseline display conditions between each rotation. Subjects showed a savings in the rate of adaptation when they had prior adaptive experiences (i.e., positive transfer of learning). This savings was associated with a reduction in activity of brain regions typically recruited early in the adaptation process, including the right inferior frontal gyrus, primary motor cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum (medial {HIII).} Moreover, although these regions exhibit activation that is correlated across subjects with the rate of acquisition, the degree of savings at transfer was correlated with activity in the right cingulate gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, right inferior parietal lobule, left middle occipital gyrus, and bilaterally in the cerebellum {(HV/VI).} The cerebellar activation was in the regions surrounding the posterior superior fissure, which is thought to be the site of storage for acquired internal models. Thus we found that motor transfer is associated with brain activation that typically characterizes late learning and storage. Transfer seems to involve retrieval of a previously formed motor memory, allowing the learner to move more quickly through the early stage of learning.},

@article{shadmehr_adaptive_1994,
	Abstract = {We investigated how the {CNS} learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

To characterize the benefit of vibrotactile feedback for a task that lacks haptic feedback, a virtual environment was used to experimentally manipulate visual, task-relevant haptic, and remote vibrotactile feedback on simple object manipulation for unimpaired subjects. The combination of visual and remote vibrotactile feedback was compared to visual feedback alone, and to simultaneous visual and direct haptic feedback to represent ideal performance. Visual and vibrotactile feedback resulted in improvement of most performance variables including difficulty ratings relative to visual feedback alone. However addition of sensory cues to visual feedback increased trial times and the increase was steeper for vibrotactile than for haptic feedback. Specifically, during vibrotactile feedback the velocity did not change, but the duration of execution increased due to improved performance, resulting in increased trial times. This result suggests future exploration of performance improvement and execution speed for augmented sensory feedback.},

	Abstract = {Most hand prostheses do not provide intentional haptic feedback about movement performance; thus users must rely almost completely on visual feedback. This paper focuses on understanding the effects of learning and different stimulation sites when vibrotactile stimulation is used as the intentional haptic feedback. Eighteen unimpaired individuals participated in this study with a robotic interface to manipulate a virtual object with visual and vibrotactile feedback at four body sites (finger, arm, neck, and foot) presented in a random order. All participants showed improvements in object manipulation performance with the addition of vibrotactile feedback. Specifically, performance showed a strong learning effect across time, with learning transferring across different sites of vibrotactile stimulation. The effects of learning over the experiment overshadowed the effects of different stimulation sites. The addition of a cognitive task slowed participants and increased the subjective difficulty. User preference ratings showed no difference in their preference among vibrotactile stimulation sites. These findings indicate that the stimulation site may not be as critical as ensuring adequate training with vibrotactile feedback during object manipulation. Future research to identify improvements in vibrotactile-based feedback parameters with amputees is warranted.},

@article{swinnen_effectiveness_2010,
	Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To assess the quality of current evidence as to the effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training in spinal cord injured patients, focusing on walking ability and performance.


{METHODS}

A search was conducted in {MEDLINE}, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database {(PEDro)} and Digital Academic Repositories {(DAREnet)} (1990-2009). Key words included "spinal cord injury", "(robot-assisted) gait rehabilitation" and "driven gait orthosis". Articles were included when complete and incomplete adult spinal cord injured patients participated in robot-assisted gait training intervention studies. The methodological quality was rated independently by 2 researchers using "van Tulder criteria list" and "evaluation of quality of an intervention study". Descriptive analyses were performed using the Population Intervention Comparison Outcome {(PICO)} method.


{RESULTS}

Two randomized controlled trials (mean quality score: 11.5/19) and 4 pre-experimental trials (mean quality score: 24.25 (standard deviation; {SD} 0.28)/48) involving 43 patients with incomplete, acute or chronic lesions between C3 and L1 were analysed. Five studies used the Lokomat and one used the {LokoHelp.} Although some improvements were reported related to body functions and activities, there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions, due to small samples sizes, methodological flaws and heterogeneity of training procedures.


{CONCLUSION}

There is currently no evidence that robot-assisted gait training improves walking function more than other locomotor training strategies. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed.},

	Abstract = {Robots can improve motor status after stroke with certain advantages, but there has been less emphasis to date on robotic developments for the hand. The goal of this study was to determine whether a hand-wrist robot would improve motor function, and to evaluate the specificity of therapy effects on brain reorganization. Subjects with chronic stroke producing moderate right arm/hand weakness received 3 weeks therapy that emphasized intense active movement repetition as well as attention, speed, force, precision and timing, and included virtual reality games. Subjects initiated hand movements. If necessary, the robot completed movements, a feature available at all visits for seven of the subjects and at the latter half of visits for six of the subjects. Significant behavioural gains were found at end of treatment, for example, in Action Research Arm Test (34 +/- 20 to 38 +/- 19, P{\textless} 0.0005) and arm motor {Fugl-Meyer} score (45 +/- 10 to 52 +/- 10, P {\textless} 0.0001). Results suggest greater gains for subjects receiving robotic assistance in all sessions as compared to those receiving robotic assistance in half of sessions. The grasp task practiced during robotic therapy, when performed during functional {MRI}, showed increased sensorimotor cortex activation across the period of therapy, while a non-practiced task, supination/pronation, did not. A robot-based therapy showed improvements in hand motor function after chronic stroke. Reorganization of motor maps during the current therapy was task-specific, a finding useful when considering generalization of rehabilitation therapy.},

@article{taub_constraint-induced_1999,
	Abstract = {A new family of rehabilitation techniques, termed {Constraint-Induced} Movement Therapy or {CI} Therapy, has been developed that controlled experiments have shown is effective in producing large improvements in limb use in the real-world environment after cerebrovascular accident {(CVA).} The signature therapy involves constraining movements of the less-affected arm with a sling for 90\% of waking hours for 2 weeks, while intensively training use of the more-affected arm. The common therapeutic factor in all {CI} Therapy techniques would appear to be inducing concentrated, repetitive practice of use of the more-affected limb. A number of neuroimaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that the massed practice of {CI} Therapy produces a massive use-dependent cortical reorganization that increases the area of cortex involved in the innervation of movement of the more-affected limb. The {CI} Therapy approach has been used successfully to date for the upper limb of patients with chronic and subacute {CVA} and patients with chronic traumatic brain injury and for the lower limb of patients with {CVA}, incomplete spinal cord injury, and fractured hip. The approach has recently been extended to focal hand dystonia of musicians and possibly phantom limb pain.},

@article{taylor_divided_2007,
	Abstract = {When humans experience externally induced errors in a movement, the motor system's feedback control compensates for those errors within the movement. The motor system's predictive control then uses information about those errors to inform future movements. The role of attention in these two distinct motor processes is unclear. Previous experiments have revealed a role for attention in motor learning over the course of many movements; however, these experimental paradigms do not determine how attention influences within-movement feedback control versus across-movement adaptation. Here we develop a dual-task paradigm, consisting of movement and audio tasks, which can differentiate and expose attention's role in these two processes of motor control. Over the course of several days, subjects performed horizontal reaching movements, with and without the audio task; movements were occasionally subjected to transient force perturbations. On movements with a force perturbation, subjects compensated for the force-induced movement errors, and on movements immediately after the force perturbation subjects exhibited adaptation. On every movement trial, subjects performed a two-tone frequency-discrimination task. The temporal specificity of the frequency-discrimination task allowed us to divide attention within and across movements. We find that divided attention did not impair the within-movement feedback control of the arm, but did reduce subsequent movement adaptation. We suggest that the secondary task interfered with the encoding and transformation of errors into changes in predictive control.},

	Abstract = {Background
Motor learning requires evaluating performance in previous movements and modifying future movements. The executive system, generally involved in planning and decision-making, could monitor and modify behavior in response to changes in task difficulty or performance. Here we aim to identify the quantitative cognitive contribution to responsive and adaptive control to identify possible overlap between cognitive and motor processes.

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
We developed a dual-task experiment that varied the trial-by-trial difficulty of a secondary cognitive task while participants performed a motor adaptation task. Subjects performed a difficulty-graded semantic categorization task while making reaching movements that were occasionally subjected to force perturbations. We find that motor adaptation was specifically impaired on the most difficult to categorize trials.

{Conclusions/Significance}
We suggest that the degree of decision-level difficulty of a particular categorization differentially burdens the executive system and subsequently results in a proportional degradation of adaptation. Our results suggest a specific quantitative contribution of executive control in motor adaptation.},

Where and how does this goal transfer occur? Here, we show that, in monkeys trained to use tools, cortical motor neurons, active during hand grasping, also become active during grasping with pliers, as if the pliers were now the hand fingers. This motor embodiment occurs both for normal pliers and for ``reverse pliers,'' an implement that requires finger opening, instead of their closing, to grasp an object.

	Abstract = {The control of a cyclical movement of the lower leg with electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscles is formulated as an optimal control problem. The time integral of knee torque is taken as the optimisation criterion. As an additional condition, every cycle a certain reference maximum angle should be reached. A model study indicates that one stimulation burst per cycle at the maximum recruitment level is a suboptimal solution to this problem. To compensate for the influence of muscle fatigue, the burst time is adaptively adjusted by a discrete time {PID-controller} on the basis of the performance in the previous cycles. This strategy appeared to be successful in experimental tests. A considerable time difference (about 0.15 s) was found between the end of the stimulation burst and the tracking of the passive state trajectory, which satisfies the maximum angle condition.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic studies have shown that there is a metabolic cost associated with carrying load. Several leg exoskeletons have been developed by various groups in an attempt to augment the load carrying capability of the human. Previous research efforts have not fully exploited the passive dynamics of walking and have largely focused on fully actuated exoskeletons that are heavy with large energy requirements. In this paper, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton design is presented that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload. Two exoskeleton architectures are pursued based on examining human walking data. A first architecture consists of springs at the hip, a variable impedance device at the knee, and springs at the ankle. A second architecture replaces the springs at the hip with a non-conservative actuator to examine the effect of adding power at desired instances throughout the gait cycle. Preliminary studies show that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle},

@article{weir_implantable_2009,
	Abstract = {We have developed a multichannel electrogmyography sensor system capable of receiving and processing signals from up to 32 implanted myoelectric sensors {(IMES).} The appeal of implanted sensors for myoelectric control is that electromyography {(EMG)} signals can be measured at their source providing relatively cross-talk-free signals that can be treated as independent control sites. An external telemetry controller receives telemetry sent over a transcutaneous magnetic link by the implanted electrodes. The same link provides power and commands to the implanted electrodes. Wireless telemetry of {EMG} signals from sensors implanted in the residual musculature eliminates the problems associated with percutaneous wires, such as infection, breakage, and marsupialization. Each implantable sensor consists of a custom-designed application-specified integrated circuit that is packaged into a biocompatible {RF} {BION} capsule from the Alfred E. Mann Foundation. Implants are designed for permanent long-term implantation with no servicing requirements. We have a fully operational system. The system has been tested in animals. Implants have been chronically implanted in the legs of three cats and are still completely operational four months after implantation.},

	Abstract = {Recent reports indicate that walking capabilities in spinal cord damaged persons significantly improve--as compared to conventional rehabilitation therapy--after intensive training of aided {(Laufband)} treadmill-stepping. In the present report, follow up investigations on two collectives of spinal cord injured (sci) persons are described who had undergone {(Laufband)} treadmill therapy either during a period of renewed rehabilitation months or years after spinal cord injury (35 chronic patients) or during their first postacute rehabilitation period (41 acute patients). Among the initially chronic patients, 20 from 25 still wheelchair-bound before the onset of {(Laufband)} treadmill therapy, ie not capable of raising from the wheelchair and walking without help by other persons, became independent walkers after therapy. Assessment of voluntary muscle activity in resting position before and after the period of therapy had shown only small increases in most patients, indicating the involvement of motor automatisms and better utilisation of remaining muscle function during walking. Follow-up assessments performed 6 months to 6 1/2 years after discharge from the hospital revealed that the walking capabilities achieved by {(Laufband)} treadmill therapy in the 35 initially chronic patients were maintained in 31 persons, in three they had further improved, in only one it was reduced. These results indicate that the improvements achieved under clinical conditions can be maintained in every day life under domestic surroundings. From 41 initially acute patients, 15 had further improved and none had reduced his walking capability 6 months to 6 years after discharge from the hospital.},

@article{wernig_laufband_1995,
	Abstract = {Rehabilitation of locomotion in spinal cord (s.c.) injured patients is unsatisfactory. Here we report the effects of a novel {`Laufband} {(LB;} treadmill) therapy' based on `rules of spinal locomotion' derived from lower vertebrates. Eighty-nine incompletely paralysed (44 chronic and 45 acute) para- and tetraplegics underwent this therapy, then were compared with 64 patients (24 chronic and 40 acute) treated conventionally. The programme consisted of daily upright walking on a motor driven {LB} initially with body weight support {(BWS)} provided by a harness and assisted limb movements by the therapists when necessary. Forty-four chronic patients with different degrees of paralysis undertook the programme for 3-20 weeks (median = 10.5), 0.5--18 years after {S.C.} damage. At the onset of {LB} therapy 33/44 patients were wheelchair-bound (no standing and/or walking without help by others) compared with 25 at completion of {LB} therapy, i.e. 76\% had learned to walk independently, 7 patients with help. Only 1 subject did not improve. It was striking that voluntary muscle activity in the resting position was still low in several patients who had gained walking capability. Eleven patients who could already walk before {LB} therapy improved in speed and endurance. Of the 44 patients, six were capable of staircase walking before {LB} therapy compared with 34 afterwards. In order to validate the apparent superiority of {LB} therapy two types of comparisons were performed. In a `temporal' control 12 spastic paretic patients, still wheelchair-bound after the period of postacute conventional therapy, performed {LB} immediately thereafter. After completion of {LB} therapy nine of these patients had learned to walk without help from others. In another control, two groups of chronic patients, matched in type of injury, time after injury (1 or more years) and history of previous rehabilitation (one or several periods of conventional therapy), were compared. One group underwent {LB} therapy (n= 29), the other conventional therapy (n= 24) for similar periods of time. From 18 wheelchair-bound patients, 14 became independent walkers after {LB}, but only 1/14 after conventional therapy. From 45 acute patients 92\% (33/36) of those wheelchair-bound at the onset of {LB} therapy became independent, but only 50\% (12/24) after conventional therapy (n= 40). It is noteworthy that voluntary muscle activity at rest was similar in both groups. The presumed underlying mechanisms are discussed in the light of the absence of any apparent effects in seven functionally completely paralysed paraplegic persons.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present the experimental validation of a framework for the systematic design, analysis, and performance enhancement of controllers that induce stable walking in N -link underactuated planar biped robots. Controllers designed via this framework act by enforcing virtual constraints---holonomic constraints imposed via feedback---on the robot's configuration, which create an attracting two-dimensional invariant set in the full walking model's state space. Stability properties of resulting walking motions are easily analyzed in terms of a two-dimensional subdynamic of the full walking model. A practical introduction to and interpretation of the framework is given. In addition, in this paper we develop the ability to regulate the average walking rate of the biped to a continuum of values by modification of within-stride and stride-boundary characteristics, such as step length.},

@article{wolbrecht_optimizing_2008,
	Abstract = {Based on evidence from recent experiments in motor learning and neurorehabilitation, we hypothesize that three desirable features for a controller for robot-aided movement training following stroke are high mechanical compliance, the ability to assist patients in completing desired movements, and the ability to provide only the minimum assistance necessary. This paper presents a novel controller that successfully exhibits these characteristics. The controller uses a standard model-based, adaptive control approach in order to learn the patient's abilities and assist in completing movements while remaining compliant. Assistance-as-needed is achieved by adding a novel force reducing term to the adaptive control law, which decays the force output from the robot when errors in task execution are small. Several tests are presented using the upper extremity robotic therapy device named {Pneu-WREX} to evaluate the performance of the adaptive, ldquoassist-as-neededrdquo controller with people who have suffered a stroke. The results of these experiments illustrate the ldquoslackingrdquo behavior of human motor control: given the opportunity, the human patient will reduce his or her output, letting the robotic device do the work for it. The experiments also demonstrate how including the ldquoassist-as-neededrdquo modification in the controller increases participation from the motor system.},

@article{wolpaw_activity-dependent_2001,
	Abstract = {Activity-dependent plasticity occurs in the spinal cord throughout life. Driven by input from the periphery and the brain, this plasticity plays an important role in the acquisition and maintenance of motor skills and in the effects of spinal cord injury and other central nervous system disorders. The responses of the isolated spinal cord to sensory input display sensitization, long-term potentiation, and related phenomena that contribute to chronic pain syndromes; they can also be modified by both classical and operant conditioning protocols. In animals with transected spinal cords and in humans with spinal cord injuries, treadmill training gradually modifies the spinal cord so as to improve performance. These adaptations by the isolated spinal cord are specific to the training regimen and underlie new approaches to restoring function after spinal cord injury. Descending inputs from the brain that occur during normal development, as a result of supraspinal trauma, and during skill acquisition change the spinal cord. The early development of adult spinal cord reflex patterns is driven by descending activity; disorders that disrupt descending activity later in life gradually change spinal cord reflexes. Athletic training, such as that undertaken by ballet dancers, is associated with gradual alterations in spinal reflexes that appear to contribute to skill acquisition. Operant conditioning protocols in animals and humans can produce comparable reflex changes and are associated with functional and structural plasticity in the spinal cord, including changes in motoneuron firing threshold and axonal conduction velocity, and in synaptic terminals on motoneurons. The corticospinal tract has a key role in producing this plasticity. Behavioral changes produced by practice or injury reflect the combination of plasticity at multiple spinal cord and supraspinal sites. Plasticity at multiple sites is both necessary-to insure continued performance of previously acquired behaviors-and inevitable-due to the ubiquity of the capacity for activity-dependent plasticity in the central nervous system. Appropriate induction and guidance of activity-dependent plasticity in the spinal cord is an essential component of new therapeutic approaches aimed at maximizing function after spinal cord injury or restoring function to a newly regenerated spinal cord. Because plasticity in the spinal cord contributes to skill acquisition and because the spinal cord is relatively simple and accessible, this plasticity is a logical and practical starting point for studying the acquisition and maintenance of skilled behaviors.},

@article{zelik_systematic_2011,
	Abstract = {Lower-limb amputees expend more energy to walk than non-amputees and have an elevated risk of secondary disabilities. Insufficient push-off by the prosthetic foot may be a contributing factor. We aimed to systematically study the effect of prosthetic foot mechanics on gait, to gain insight into fundamental prosthetic design principles. We varied a single parameter in isolation, the energy-storing spring in a prototype prosthetic foot, the controlled energy storage and return {(CESR)} foot, and observed the effect on gait. Subjects walked on the {CESR} foot with three different springs. We performed parallel studies on amputees and on non-amputees wearing prosthetic simulators. In both groups, spring characteristics similarly affected ankle and body center-of-mass {(COM)} mechanics and metabolic cost. Softer springs led to greater energy storage, energy return, and prosthetic limb {COM} push-off work. But metabolic energy expenditure was lowest with a spring of intermediate stiffness, suggesting biomechanical disadvantages to the softest spring despite its greater push-off. Disadvantages of the softest spring may include excessive heel displacements and {COM} collision losses. We also observed some differences in joint kinetics between amputees and non-amputees walking on the prototype foot. During prosthetic push-off, amputees exhibited reduced energy transfer from the prosthesis to the {COM} along with increased hip work, perhaps due to greater energy dissipation at the knee. Nevertheless, the results indicate that spring compliance can contribute to push-off, but with biomechanical trade-offs that limit the degree to which greater push-off might improve walking economy.},

@article{ziegler_why_2010,
	Abstract = {Spinal Wistar Hannover rats trained to step bipedally on a treadmill with manual assistance of the hindlimbs have been shown to improve their stepping ability. Given the improvement in motor performance with practice and the ability of the spinal cord circuitry to learn to step more effectively when the mode of training allows variability, we examined why this intrinsic variability is an important factor. Intramuscular {EMG} electrodes were implanted to monitor and compare the patterns of activation of flexor (tibialis anterior) and extensor (soleus) muscles associated with a fixed-trajectory and assist-as-needed {(AAN)} step training paradigms in rats after a complete midthoracic {(T8-T9)} spinal cord transection. Both methods involved a robotic arm attached to each ankle of the rat to provide guidance during stepping. The fixed trajectory allowed little variance between steps, and the {AAN} provided guidance only when the ankle deviated a specified distance from the programmed trajectory. We hypothesized that an {AAN} paradigm would impose fewer disruptions of the control strategies intrinsic to the spinal locomotor circuitry compared with a fixed trajectory. Intrathecal injections of quipazine were given to each rat to facilitate stepping. Analysis confirmed that there were more corrections within a fixed-trajectory step cycle and consequently there was less coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles during the {AAN} paradigm. These data suggest that some critical level of variation in the specific circuitry activated and the resulting kinematics reflect a fundamental feature of the neural control mechanisms even in a highly repetitive motor task.},

	Abstract = {This review presents an analytical and comparative survey of upper limb prosthesis acceptance and abandonment as documented over the past 25 years, detailing areas of consumer dissatisfaction and ongoing technological advancements. English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words upper limb and prosthesis. Articles focused on upper limb prostheses and addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates; (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200 articles were included in the review process with 40 providing rates of prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics, study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article. Mean rejection rates of 45\% and 35\% were observed in the literature for body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations. Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26\%) and electric (23\%) devices were observed in adult populations while the average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16\%) and adult (20\%) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and methodological differences between studies. Future research should comprise of controlled, multifactor studies adopting standardized outcome measures in order to promote comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting prosthesis use and abandonment. An enhanced understanding of these factors is needed to optimize prescription practices, guide design efforts, and satiate demand for evidence-based measures of intervention.},

	Abstract = {Impairment of hand function is prevalent among stroke survivors, motivating the search for effective rehabilitation therapy. Recent studies have suggested that for upper extremity functional recovery, repetitive training with virtual reality is helpful. Repetitive training can be facilitated with assistance from mechanical devices. Thus, we have developed a training environment that integrates augmented reality (AR) with assistive devices for post-stroke hand rehabilitation. The AR element of our environment utilizes head mounted display and virtual objects for reach-and-grasp task training. The assistive device consists of either a body-powered orthosis (BPO) or a pneumatic-powered device (PPD), both of which are incorporated into gloves. This environment can be easily set up and calibrated, is customizable for individual users, and requires active user participation. Additionally, it can be used with both real and virtual objects, as desired. We are currently conducting pilot case studies to assess ease of use and efficacy. At present, one stroke survivor from each of the three training conditions, AR-with-BPO, AR-with-PPD and AR-only (acting as the control), has completed the 6-week training paradigm. Preliminary findings suggest user acceptance of the technology and some potential for beneficial effects.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the utility of a passive gravity-balanced arm orthosis, the Wilmington robotic exoskeleton (WREX), for patients with neuromuscular diseases. The WREX, a four-degrees-of-freedom functional orthosis, is energized by rubber bands to eliminate gravity and is attached to the wheelchair. The development and clinical testing of WREX is described in this report. Seventeen patients (14 boys and 3 girls) with muscular disabilities participated in the study. Ages ranged from 4 to 20 years. Criteria for inclusion included a weakened arm, use of a wheelchair, the ability to grasp and release objects, and the ability to provide feedback on device use. Testing consisted of administering the Jebsen test of hand function without WREX and then testing again after approximately two weeks of wearing the WREX orthosis. The timed results of each task within the test then were compared. Specific tasks related to vertical movement required less time to perform with the WREX. A large number of subjects were able to perform the Jebsen tasks with the WREX, where they were unable to perform the task without the WREX. Patients can benefit from WREX because it increases their performance in daily living activities and makes many tasks possible. The range-of-motion in the patients' arms increased considerably, while the time required to complete some of the Jebsen test tasks decreased. Most patients were very receptive to WREX, although a few were ambivalent.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this project is to develop a means for individuals with stroke to practice arm movement therapy at home with remote monitoring. We previously developed a Web-based system for repetitive movement training (Java Therapy). This paper describes a new input device for the system that measures and assists in naturalistic arm movement, as well as software enhancements. The new input device is an instrumented, adult-sized version of Wilmington robotic exoskeleton (WREX), which is a five degrees-of-freedom orthosis that counterbalances the weight of the arm using elastic bands. To test the ability of the new device (Training-WREX or "T-WREX") to measure and assist in functional arm movements, we measured five chronic stroke subjects' movement ability while wearing the orthosis without gravity balance compared to wearing the orthosis with gravity balance. T-WREX's gravity balance function improved a clinical measure of arm movement (Fugl-Meyer Score), range of motion of reaching movements, and accuracy of drawing movements. Coupled with an enhanced version of Java Therapy, T-WREX will thus provide a means to assist functional arm movement training at home, either over the Web in real-time, or stand-alone with periodic communication with a remote site.},

	Abstract = {This study presents the results of a novel paradigm for characterizing abnormal coordination in subjects with hemiparesis. Subjects generated maximum voluntary torques (MVTs) isometrically in four randomly ordered blocks consisting of elbow flexion/extension, shoulder flexion/extension, shoulder abduction/adduction, and shoulder external/internal rotation. A 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) load cell was used to measure torques in secondary DOFs at the elbow and shoulder, as well as in the torque direction the subject was attempting to maximize. This allowed characterization of the multijoint torque patterns associated with the generation of MVTs in the eight directions examined. Significant differences were found between the torque patterns exhibited by the paretic limb of the hemiparetic group (n = 8) and those observed for the nonparetic limb and control group (n = 4). Potential neural and biomechanical mechanisms underlying these abnormal torque patterns are discussed along with implications for the functional use of the paretic limb.},

@article{Dewald1995,
	Abstract = {To study abnormal spatial patterns of muscle activation in hemiparetic stroke, we compared EMG activity in paretic and contralateral elbow and shoulder muscles of 10 hemiparetic subjects during 1.5-s voluntary isometric contractions, against five to eight different loads. Isometric forces were generated in eight directions, referenced to a plane orthogonal to the long axis of the forearm, and were recorded by a three degrees of freedom load cell, mounted at the wrist. Surface and intramuscular EMGs of six elbow and six shoulder muscles were recorded from both impaired and contralateral upper extremities of each subject. The spatial characteristics of EMG activation of individual muscles were summarized using two measures. The first, called the 'net resultant EMG vector' is a new measure which calculated the vector sum of EMG magnitudes for each of the eight directions, and the second, index of EMG focus, is a measure of the range of EMG activation recorded for each load level. Use of these measures permitted us to describe spatial EMG characteristics quantitatively, which has not been done previously. We observed consistent and statistically significant shifts in the resultant EMG vector directions in the impaired limb, especially in shoulder and other proximal muscles. Significant increases in the angular range of EMG activity were also identified and were most evident at the elbow. Correlation analysis techniques were used to assess the degree of coactivation of different muscle pairs. There were consistent EMG coactivation patterns observed across all subjects (both normal and hemiparetic). However, in spasticparetic limbs, additional novel coactivational relationships were also recorded, especially between elbow flexors/shoulder abductors and elbow extensors/shoulder adductors. These novel coactivation patterns represent a reduction in the number of possible muscle combinations, or in the number of possible 'synergies' in the paretic limb of the stroke subject. This reduction in number of 'synergies' could result from a loss of descending command options; from an increased reliance on residual, descending brainstem pathways (such as the reticulospinal and vestibulospinal projections); from changes in spinal interneuronal excitability; or from a combination of several of these factors. The relative merits of these hypotheses are addressed.},

For therapeutic applications of robotic orthoses, slacking may reduce human effort during rehabilitation training, with negative consequences for use-dependent motor recovery. For assistive applications of robotic orthoses, slacking may allow the motor system to learn to take advantage of force amplification provided by an orthosis, with positive consequences for human energy efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We tested a novel control strategy for robotic rehabilitation devices used by individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. Symmetry-based resistance increases resistance when limb forces become more asymmetric during bilateral exercise. The underlying rationales for the control mode are that it will guide patients to increase paretic limb activation while teaching them to accurately gauge paretic limb force production relative to the non-paretic limb. During a one day training session, seven subjects post-stroke performed lower limb extensions in symmetry-based resistance mode on a robotic exercise machine. Subjects improved lower limb symmetry from 28.6\%+/-3.9\% to 36.2\%+/-4.3\% while under symmetry-based resistance training (ANOVA, P = 0.03), but did not maintain the improved lower limb symmetry during a constant resistance post-test. Two subjects that showed the large improvements in symmetry during the one day session performed additional days of training. Those results suggest that some patients demonstrate long lasting benefits with symmetry-based resistance training.},

	Abstract = {In cognitive science and philosophy, the conception of cognition has evolved rapidly in recent years. It is no longer strictly a process that happens inside the head, intervening between perception and action. Instead, cognition is considered something that subsumes both perception and action, engages the body, and even incorporates the response of objects in the environment to actions taken upon them. One speaks of cognition being embodied and extended. Cognitive processes such as problem solving might actually involve the coupled dynamics of the body and the environment, where the finding of problem solutions involves interactively driving the coupled dynamics toward behaviors that satisfy the task goals of an individual. Researchers in haptics have long been working with the notions of dynamical coupling between the body and environment, with interwoven definitions of perception and action, and with flexible conceptions of the proximal and distal and the physical and virtual. It is perhaps striking to suppose that the activity during which our users wield our interface devices might be considered cognition itself. We suggest in this paper that the field of haptics is uniquely positioned to draw upon and to contribute to active debates in cognitive science, and that a new interpretation of ``interface'' can be useful in launching such an endeavor.},

	Abstract = {Purpose: To gain an understanding of the embodied perceptual experience of successful prosthesis. Method: The data for this study were transcripts derived from in-depth semi-structured e-mail (n = 21) and face-to-face (n = 14) interviews, and the documentary analysis of an e-mail discussion group for prosthesis users. This qualitative data was subject to an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Analysis of the research data identified six themes in the perceptually embodied experiences of prosthesis users: Adjusting to a prosthetic; The Balance of the Body; Awareness of the Prosthesis; The Knowing Body; The Phantom Becomes the Prosthesis: Extending the Body; and The Prosthesis as Tool or Corporeal Structure. Conclusion: The often-cited reasons for the rejection of prostheses are frequently part of the initial experiences of `successful' prosthesis users also. This suggests the need to sufficiently motivate potential prosthesis users in the period between an experience of prosthesis use as unn...},

	Abstract = {We tested a novel control strategy for robotic rehabilitation devices used by individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. Symmetry-based resistance increases resistance when limb forces become more asymmetric during bilateral exercise. The underlying rationales for the control mode are that it will guide patients to increase paretic limb activation while teaching them to accurately gauge paretic limb force production relative to the non-paretic limb. During a one day training session, seven subjects post-stroke performed lower limb extensions in symmetry-based resistance mode on a robotic exercise machine. Subjects improved lower limb symmetry from 28.6\%+/-3.9\% to 36.2\%+/-4.3\% while under symmetry-based resistance training (ANOVA, P = 0.03), but did not maintain the improved lower limb symmetry during a constant resistance post-test. Two subjects that showed the large improvements in symmetry during the one day session performed additional days of training. Those results suggest that some patients demonstrate long lasting benefits with symmetry-based resistance training.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of patient-cooperative robotic gait training for improving locomotor function of a chronic stroke survivor with severe lower extremity motor impairments. DESIGN: Single-subject crossover design SETTING: The study was performed in a controlled Laboratory Setting PARTICIPANT: A 62-year-old male with right temporal lobe ischemic stroke was recruited for this study. The baseline lower-extremity Fugl-Meyer score of the subject was 10 on a scale of 34, which represented severe impairment in the paretic leg. However, the subject had good ambulation level (community walker with the aid of a stick cane and ankle foot orthosis) and showed no signs of sensory or cognitive impairments. INTERVENTIONS: The subject underwent 12 sessions (3 x per week for 4 weeks) of conventional robotic training with the Lokomat, where the robot provided full assistance to leg movements while walking, followed by 12 sessions (3 x per week for 4 weeks) of patient-cooperative robotic control training, where the robot provided minimal guidance to leg movements during walking. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were evaluated before the start of the intervention, immediately after 4-weeks of conventional robotic training, and immediately after 4-weeks of cooperative control robotic training. These included: (1) Self-selected and fast walking speed, (2) 6-minute walk test, (3) Timed Up and Go test, and (4) Lower extremity Fugl-Meyer score RESULTS: Results showed that clinical outcomes changed minimally after full guidance robotic training, but improved considerably after 4-weeks of reduced guidance robotic training. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this case study suggest that cooperative control robotic training is superior to conventional robotic training and is a feasible option to restoring locomotor function in ambulatory stroke survivors with severe motor impairments. A larger trial is needed to verify the efficacy of this advanced robotic control strategy in facilitating gait recovery after stroke.},

@article{Simon2007,
	Abstract = {Robotic devices hold much promise for use as rehabilitation aids but their success depends on identifying effective strategies for controlling human-robot interaction forces. We developed a robotic device to test a novel method of controlling interaction forces with the intent of improving force symmetry in the limbs. Users perform lower limb extensions against a computer-controlled resistive load. The control software increases resistance above baseline in proportion to lower limb force asymmetry (balance between left and right limb forces). As a preliminary trial to test the device and controller, we conducted two experiments on neurologically intact subjects. In experiment 1, one group of subjects received symmetry-based resistance while performing lower limb extensions (n=10). A control group performed the same movements with constant resistance (n=10). The symmetry-based resistance group improved lower limb symmetry during training (ANOVA, p<0.05), whereas the control subjects did not. In experiment 2, subjects (n=10) successfully used symmetry-based resistance to alter their lower limb force production towards a target asymmetry (ANOVA, p<0.05). These studies suggest that symmetry-based resistance may hold rehabilitation benefits after orthopedic or neurological injury. Specifically, performing strength training therapy with this controller may allow hemiparetic individuals to focus better on increasing strength and neuromuscular recruitment in their paretic limb while experiencing symmetric limb forces.},

We evaluated and rated each study using either the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or the Downs and Black scale for non-RCTs. We reviewed 30 articles (14 RCTs, 16 non-RCTs) that examined the effects of locomotor training with robotic assistance in patients following stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and Parkinson disease (PD). This review supports that locomotor training with robotic assistance is beneficial for improving walking function in individuals following a stroke and SCI. Gait speed and endurance were not found to be significantly different among patients with motor incomplete SCI after a variety of locomotor training approaches. Limited evidence demonstrates that locomotor training with robotic assistance is beneficial in populations of patients with MS, TBI, or PD.

However, the disabling after-effects of stroke often make such exercises impossible at the onset of therapy. To facilitate treadmill training of paraparetic patients, a robot-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat) was developed. We investigated the effects of the Lokomat when used with hemiparetic patients.},

@article{Johnson2005,
	Abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of disability among adults in the United States. Behaviors such as learned nonuse hinder hemiplegic stroke survivors from the full use of both arms in activities of daily living. Active force-feedback cues, designed to restrain the use of the less-affected arm, were embedded into a meaningful driving simulation environment to create robot-assisted therapy device, driver's simulation environment for arm therapy (SEAT). The study hypothesized that force-feedback control mode could "motivate" stroke survivors to increase the productive use of their impaired arm throughout a bilateral steering task, by providing motivating feedback and reinforcement cues to reduce the overuse of the less-affected arm. Experimental results demonstrate that the force cues counteracted the tendency of hemiplegic subjects to produce counter-productive torques only during bilateral steering tasks (p < 0.05) that required the movement of their impaired arm in steering directions up and against gravity. Impaired arm activity was quantified in terms of torques due to the measured tangential forces on the split-steering wheel of driver's SEAT during bilateral steering. Results were verified using surface electromyograms recorded from key muscles in the impaired arm.},

In preliminary testing, nine chronic stroke subjects with mild to moderate motor deficits practiced with AutoCITE for 3 h each weekday for 2 weeks. Subjects wore a padded mitt on the less-affected hand for a target of 90\% of their waking hours. In terms of effect sizes, gains were large and significant on the Motor Activity Log, and moderate to large on the Wolf Motor Function Test. These gains were comparable to the gains of a matched group of 12 subjects who received standard Constraint-Induced Movement therapy.},
