\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, a convex approximation of the reachable sets of a class of uncertain polynomial hybrid drift systems is presented. The presented method optimizes over the set of unsigned measures using converging moment relaxations and SDPs. A commentary on the accuracy and the adequacy of the proposed method is provided using examples. A future work will extend the work herein by synthesizing \emph{cautious} feedback control laws that guarantee constraint satisfaction.
