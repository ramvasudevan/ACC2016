\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, a convex optimization approach is presented to compute the backwards reachable set for quasi-uncertain hybrid systems.
The presented method optimizes over the set of unsigned measures using converging moment relaxations that can be solved using SDPs.
A commentary on the accuracy and the adequacy of the proposed method is provided using examples. 
Future work will extend the work herein by incorporating control laws while computing the backwards reachable set.
