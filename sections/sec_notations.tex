  \section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}
  This section defines the notation, the class of systems, and problem considered throughout the paper.

  \subsection{Notation}
  In the remainder of this text the following notation is adopted:
Sets are italicized and capitalized (ex. $K$).
The boundary of a set $K$ is denoted by $\partial K$.
% The disjoint union of sets is defined as: $\coprod_{i\in I}K_i=\cup_{i\in I}K_i\times \{i\}$.
Finite truncations of the set of natural numbers are expressed as \mbox{$\N_n:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$}.
The set of continuous on a compact set $K$ are denoted by $\mathcal C(K)$.
% The set of continuous and absolutely continuous functions on a compact set $K$ are represented as $\mathcal C(K)$ and $\mathcal C_{ab}(K)$ respectively.
The ring of polynomials in $x$ is denoted by $\R[x]$, and the degree of a polynomial is equal to degree its largest multinomial; the degree of the multinomial $x^\alpha,\,\alpha\in \R_{\ge 0}^n$ is $|\alpha|=\|\alpha\|_1$; and $\R_d[x]$ is the set of polynomials in $x$ with maximum degree $d$.

The dual to $\mathcal C(K)$ is the set of Radon measures on $K$, denoted as $\mathcal M(K)$, and the pairing of $\mu\in \mathcal M(K)$ and $v\in \mathcal C(K)$ is:
  \begin{align}
  \ip{\mu,v}=\int_{K}v(x)\,d\mu(x).
  \end{align}
We denote the nonnegative Radon measures by ${\cal M}_+(K)$.
The space of Radon probability measures on $K$ is denoted by ${\cal P}(K)$.
The Lebesgue measure is denoted by $\lambda$.
Finally, supports of measures, $\mu$, are identified as $supp(\mu)$.

\subsection{Quasi-Uncertain Hybrid Systems}
  The class of uncertain systems considered in this study consists of hybrid systems that conform to the following definition and undergo executions as described by Alg.~\ref{alg:execution}.
\begin{defn}[Inspired by \cite{Burden2015}]\label{def:system}
  A `quasi-uncertain' hybrid system is a tuple \mbox{$\mathcal H=(\mathcal J,\mathcal E,\mathcal D,\mathcal F,\mathcal G,\mathcal R,\Gamma)$}, where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal J$ is a finite set of indices of discrete states in of $\mathcal H$;
    \item $\mathcal E\subset \mathcal J\times \mathcal J$ is a set of two-tuples describing directed edges;
    \item $\mathcal D = \{D_j\}_{j \in {\cal J}}$ is the set of domains where each $D_j$ is a compact $n_j$-dimensional manifold with boundary where $n_j \in \N$;
    \item $\Gamma = \{\mu_{\theta_j} \}_{j \in {\cal J}}$ where $\mu_{\theta_j}\in \mathcal P(\Theta_j)$ describes the uncertainty associated with discrete state $j \in {\cal J}$;
    \item $\mathcal F=\{\tilde f_j\}_{j\in \mathcal J}$ where $\tilde{f}_j: D_j \times \Theta_j \to D_j$ is a Lipschitz continuous function describing the dynamics on $D_j$;
    \item $\mathcal G=\{G_e\}_{e \in {\cal E}}$ is the set of guards where each $G_{(j,j')} \subset \partial D_j$ is a closed, embedded, co-dimension 1 submanifold with boundary, and is a guard in domain $j \in {\cal J}$ that defines a transition to mode $j' \in {\cal J}$;
    \item $\mathcal R = \{R_e\}_{e \in {\cal E}}$ is the set of reset maps, where each map is a continuously differentiable injection $R_{(j,j')}: G_{(j,j')} \to D_{j'}$ and defines the transition from guard $G_{(j,j')}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\noindent The discrete states are sometimes referred to as {\em modes} of the system.

To avoid any ambiguity during transitions between discrete states, we assume the following:
\begin{assump}
    In each discrete state, the guards are mutually exclusive; i.e.
    \begin{align}
    \mathcal G_{(i,j)}\cap \mathcal G_{(i,k)}=\emptyset,\phantom{8}\forall (i,j),(i,k)\in \mathcal E, \forall j\ne k
    \end{align}
\end{assump}
In addition, the systems are not allowed to undergo infinite mode transitions in any finite time-interval.
\begin{assump}
  $\mathcal H$ has no zeno execution.
  \label{assump:zeno}
\end{assump}
% To complete the characterization of systems in $\mathfrak{U}$, a description of how the components in Defn.~\ref{def:system} are related is warranted.
Alg~\ref{alg:execution} describes the finite-time execution, $[0,T]$, of a hybrid system, $\mathcal H$, as in Defn.~\ref{def:system} as follows:
Suppose that the system enters mode $j$ at time $t$ at location $x \in D_j$.
Recall the dynamics in this domain, $\tilde f_j$, are a function of a random parameter drawn from the distribution $\mu_{\theta_j}$; let this random variable take the value $\theta$.
The trajectory of the hybrid system beginning at time $t$ at $x$ is then given by any absolutely continuous function that satisfies the differential equation $\tilde f_j$ with a fixed $\theta$ as described in Steps~\circled{5}\&\circled{6}.
This trajectory evolves until either the time evolution passes $T$ or the trajectory arrives at a guard, whichever happens first.
Steps~\circled{7}--\circled{11} isolates the first hitting-time of a guard of mode $j$ and resets $\mathcal H$ to a new mode whereafter the same procedure is repeated until $t=T$.

% Consider a (non-hybrid) system, $\Sigma$, with states denoted by $\gamma$ whose dynamics is identical to that of $x$ in mode $j$, $\tilde f_j$; and let $\gamma$ have identical initial conditions as $x$ in mode $j$.
% The trajectory of the states of $\Sigma$ is given by an absolutely continuous function that is the solution to the ODE in Steps~\circled{5}\&\circled{6}.
% If $\gamma(s),\,s\in [t,T]$, does not satisfies any of the constraints that define the guards of mode $j$ of $\mathcal H$, then the trajectory of $x$ remains in mode $j$ and is identical to that of $\gamma$, and the execution is terminated; otherwise, $\mathcal H$ undergoes a mode transition.

\begin{algorithm}[!t]

Note that the uncertainty does not evolve with time.
The uncertainty only changes when the system mode resets.
This class of systems is still quite rich as is illustrated by the two representative examples ---a simple 1D pedagogical example, and a 2D representative of walking models---presented next.
\begin{example}[1-D Quasi-Uncertain Linear System]
\label{example:1D}
Consider a quasi-uncertain linear system evolving on a circle with dynamics:
\begin{align}
	\dot x = -0.7x+0.2\theta-0.1,
\end{align}
where $D_1 = [-1,1]$, ${\cal G} = \emptyset$, and $\theta\in [-1,1]$ is an unknown parameter affecting the dynamics.
The uncertain parameter can be thought of as arising due to structural modeling errors, or as a result of reducing a singular-perturbed system.

\end{figure}

\begin{example}[Planar Rimless Wheel (PRW) with Uneven Terrain]
\label{example:rw}
The planar rimless wheel---constituted by a massless axle to which $n$ (angularly) equidistant spokes are connected---is a simple model of legged locomotion.
Figure~\ref{fig:rw_schematic} presents a schematic of a rimless wheel---with spokes separated by an angle $2\alpha$---rolling down an inclined plane.
The PRW is a hybrid system consisting of one mode; every time the spoke makes contact with the surface of the inclined plane, the system undergoes a reset.
The continuous dynamics of the PRW are:
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dot \beta& \ddot\beta
  \end{bmatrix}'=\begin{bmatrix}
    \dot\beta&\sin(\beta)
  \end{bmatrix}',
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the angle between the vertical (which is defined as the line that is perpendicular to the base of the inclined plane) and the pivoting spoke.
Once the swinging spoke makes contact with the terrain, the states are reset as:
\begin{align}
R_{(1,1)}(\beta^-,\dot \beta^-)=\begin{bmatrix}
    2\gamma-\beta^-&
    \cos(2\alpha)\,\dot\beta^-
  \end{bmatrix}'.
\end{align}
For a PRW rolling down an inclined plane with flat terrain, at the instance when the swinging spoke makes contact with the ground $\beta = \gamma + \alpha$.
To encode the uncertainty due to terrain height, suppose the PRW encounters a step of size $\delta$, then if we let $\theta =  \arcsin \left( \frac{\delta}{2 l \sin \alpha} \right)$, the guard is defined as:
\begin{align}
G_{(1,1)}=\{ (\beta, \dot{\beta})\mid \beta=\gamma+\alpha+\theta\}.
\end{align}
Observe that as the PRW continues to roll, \emph{the terrain is allowed to change since the random variable $\theta$ is allowed to take a distinct value after each contact with the ground}.
\end{example}

\subsection{Problem Description}
{\em The objective of this work is to estimate the largest set of initial conditions from which all state trajectories of $\mathcal H$, regardless of any encountered uncertainty, reach a terminal set by a pre-specified time, $T$.}
To formalize the definition of this \emph{uncertain backwards reachable set}, we denote the terminal set as $X_T$ and its projection into each mode by $X_{(T,j)}$, which we assume is compact.
For convenience, we define $\mathcal T=[0,\,T]$.
We define the uncertain backwards reachable set mode-wise:
\begin{align}
\begin{aligned}
     X_{(0,j)}=\{x_0\in D_j \mid\ &\forall x: [0,T] \to {\cal D} \text{ constructed via Alg. 1} \\\ & \text{with } x(0) = x_0, \, x(T) \in X_T \}
     \label{eq:brs}
\end{aligned}
\end{align}
The uncertain backwards reachable set is then defined as $X_0 = \{X_{(0,j)} \}_{j\in {\cal J}}$.
Observe that by definition all initial conditions beginning from $X_0$ must reach $X_T$ at time $T$ regardless of mode transitions and uncertainty encountered along the way.
